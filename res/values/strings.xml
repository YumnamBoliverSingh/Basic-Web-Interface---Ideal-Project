    <string name="string_startupBasics11"><u>If working nine to five isn’t suited to you, perhaps it’s time to climb your own ladder, set a pace that suits you, and make your mark on the world. If you have a bright idea or a burning interest, here are seven good reasons for starting a business today.</u>

1. <b><i>Be your own boss</i></b>
Instead of bashing your head against a wall every time your boss makes a mistake, be the one making decisions – and hold yourself accountable to them. Of course, i\t’s human nature to want to avoid risks, but in the words of Nora Denzel, former CEO of American company Outerwall, \“If you don\’t take risks, you\’ll always work for someone who does.

If that thought scares you, it\’s time you begin planning your journey to become an entrepreneur. Here are just a few of the benefits of becoming your own boss:

Greater control: You decide where finances go, what kind of company culture you want, and the quality of work that should be expected
Flexible hours: You choose your working hours, meaning you have complete control over when you work and when you don\’t
Diverse learning: You receive a crash course in every aspect of starting a business – from financial management to health and safety

2. <b><i>Define your job description</i></b>
If you think you possess a range of key talents, entrepreneurship presents a way to utilize these skills to their full potential.

As an entrepreneur, you\’ll fill many roles in your business, especially when starting out, which is why you can\’t be afraid of doing the dirty work. Many days you\’ll find yourself in the position of anything from leader and marketer to therapist and receptionist.

Essential entrepreneurial skills include the following:

Business management skills, which include multitasking, delegating, and making decisions about your company\’s health and profitability
Teamwork and leadership skills are essential – in a small business, you\’ll likely be supervisor and team member
Customer service skills will help you connect with your customer base and establish opening partnerships
Financial skills are needed to ensure you understand and control the money side of your business
Strategic thinking and planning skills are necessary to stay competitive, reach your business goals, and grow your market reach
Branding, marketing, and networking skills will be deployed to promote and grow your brand until you can hire someone to take this over
3. <b><i>Turn your passion into profit</i></b>
Starting a business is risky, so it\’s important to remember why you\’re doing this when the going gets tough.

Twenty percent of small businesses don\’t survive their first year, and nearly a third fail in the second. Half fold after five years in business.6 Those first few years of a business are hard, which is why passion is crucial to sustaining you.

Try to keep these benefits of starting your business in mind during times of doubt:

It\’s personal: You get to invest your time and energy into something you love
Self-actualization: You get to build your vision instead of someone else\’s
Watch it grow: You get to see your creation grow from an idea into an empire
4. <b><i>Increase your earning potential</i></b>
Perhaps your current job doesn\’t pay what you\’d like, or maybe you\’ve got a sideline passion project that has the potential to become a lucrative full-time career. Either way, you\’ll have to put in the hours to turn it into a business. As U.S. entrepreneur Lori Greiner says, \“Entrepreneurs are willing to work 80 hours a week to avoid working 40 hours a week for someone else.</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics12">You may struggle with finances in the beginning, but draw your motivation from these famous entrepreneurs who started out with pennies and turned them into billions:

WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum went from standing in line for food stamps8 to creating a messaging app now used by more than two billion people worldwide9
Sara Blakely sold fax machines door-to-door before founding clothing company Spanx, which helped her become the youngest female self-made billionaire in the world10
Shahid Khan washed dishes part-time while studying. He now owns one of the largest private companies in the world, Flex-n-Gate, along with NFL team, the Jacksonville Jaguars11
5. <b><i>Improve the lives of others</i></b>
In the U.S. alone, new businesses create 1.5 million jobs annually.12 Starting a new business means you have the opportunity to hire and train those who may not have had the opportunity for decent work in the past. It also means you get to make a meaningful impact on society.

These three entrepreneurs have used their entrepreneurial prowess to do something good in the world:

Jimmy Wales co-founded Wikipedia, creating the world\’s biggest online encyclopedia and a source of information for millions13
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has, along with ex-wife Melinda, donated more than $45 billion to charitable causes14
Chuck Feeney, who co-founded the Duty Free Shoppers Group, made it his mission to give away his fortune, donating $8 billion to charity15

6. <b><i>Learn to fail and learn from your failures</i></b>
Some companies fail because they make a poor product, others because their product is mistimed. Most companies fold because of a lack of market need for their product or service or because they run out of capital.16

When you consider that 90 percent of start-ups and 75 percent of venture-backed start-ups fall by the wayside, it becomes clear that failure is something to be addressed head-on and learned from.17 Here\’s how you can do that.

Accept responsibility: Don\’t blame the mistake on something else – take ownership of it
Respond accordingly: Understand why you made the mistake and how you can avoid it in the future
Do the humor test: Can you laugh at the last mistake you made\? If so, chances are you\’ve processed it and moved on
7. <b><i>Become an expert</i></b>
Instead of waiting for someone to give you a chance to be the best at something you\’re passionate about, create your own opportunities.

Follow the words of Steve Jobs: “\Your time is limited, so don\’t waste it living someone else\’s life. Don\’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people\’s thinking.

\“Don\’t let the noise of others\’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

Become an expert in one thing by:

Identifying your passion: Find something you\’re passionate about – this means you won\’t mind pursuing it after hours
Making time for it: The best way to become an expert is to practice, practice, and practice some more, whether this is through experience or gathering knowledge by taking online business courses
Taking every opportunity: Whether it\s paid or unpaid, big or small – accept anything that challenges
        you</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics21"><b><i>What Is a Partnership\?</i></b>
A partnership is a formal arrangement by two or more parties to manage and operate a business and share its profits.

There are several types of partnership arrangements. In particular, in a partnership business, all partners share liabilities and profits equally, while in others, partners may have limited liability. There also is the so-called \"silent partner\", in which one party is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business.



<b><i>How a Partnership Works</i></b>
In a broad sense, a partnership can be any endeavor undertaken jointly by multiple parties. The parties may be governments, non-profits enterprises, businesses, or private individuals. The goals of a partnership also vary widely.

Within the narrow sense of a for-profit venture undertaken by two or more individuals, there are three main categories of partnership: <i>general partnership, limited partnership, and limited liability partnership.</i>

In a general partnership, all parties share legal and financial liability equally. The individuals are personally responsible for the debts the partnership takes on. Profits are also shared equally. The specifics of profit sharing will almost certainly be laid out in writing in a partnership agreement.

 When drafting a partnership agreement, an expulsion clause should be included, detailing what events are grounds for expelling a partner.
<u>Limited liability partnerships</u> (LLPs) are a common structure for professionals, such as accountants, lawyers, and architects. This arrangement limits partners\' personal liability so that, for example, if one partner is sued for malpractice, the assets of other partners are not at risk. Some law and accounting firms make a further distinction between equity partners and salaried partners. The latter is more senior than associates but does not have an ownership stake. They are generally paid bonuses based on the firm\'s profits.

Limited partnerships are a hybrid of general partnerships and limited liability partnerships. At least one partner must be a general partner, with full personal liability for the partnership\'s debts. At least one other is a silent partner whose liability is limited to the amount invested. This silent partner generally does not participate in the management or day-to-day operation of the partnership.

Finally, the awkwardly-named <i>limited liability limited partnership</i> is a new and relatively uncommon variety. This is a limited partnership that provides a greater shield from liability for its general partners.

<b><i>Taxes and Partnerships</i></b>
There is no federal statute defining partnerships, but nevertheless, the Internal Revenue Code (Chapter 1, Subchapter K) includes detailed rules on their federal tax treatment.

Partnerships do not pay income tax. The tax responsibility passes through to the partners, who are not considered employees for tax purposes.


Individuals in partnerships may receive more favorable tax treatment than if they founded a corporation. That is, corporate profits are taxed, as are the dividends paid to owners or shareholders. Partnerships\' profits, on the other hand, are not double-taxed in this way.</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics22"><b><i>Special Considerations</i></b>
The basic varieties of partnerships can be found throughout common law jurisdictions, such as the United States, the UK, and the Commonwealth nations. There are, however, differences in the laws governing them in each jurisdiction.

The U.S. has no federal statute that defines the various forms of partnership. However, every state except Louisiana has adopted one form or another of the Uniform Partnership Act; so, the laws are similar from state to state. The standard version of the act defines the partnership as a separate legal entity from its partners, which is a departure from the previous legal treatment of partnerships.

Other common law jurisdictions, including England, do not consider partnerships to be independent legal entities.

<b><i>How Does a Partnership Differ From Other Forms of Business Organization\?</i></b>
A partnership is a way of structuring a business that involves two or more individuals (the partners). It involves a contractual agreement (the partnership agreement) between all of the partners that set the terms and conditions of their business relationship, including the distribution of ownership, responsibilities, and profits and losses. Partnerships outline and clearly define a business relationship and responsibility.



Unlike LLCs or corporations, however, partners are personally held liable for any business debts of the partnership, which means that creditors or other claimants can go after the partners\' personal assets.  Because of this, individuals who wish to form a partnership should be extremely selective when choosing partners.

<b><i>If Partners Don\'t Have Limited Liability Why Set Up a Partnership\?</i></b>
Partnerships have several benefits. They are often easier to set up than LLCs or corporations and do not involve a formal incorporation process through a government. This has the added benefit of not being subject to the same rules and regulations that apply to corporations and LLCs. Partnerships also tend to be more tax-friendly.

<b><i>What About Limited Partnerships\?</i></b>
In limited partnerships (LPs), there are general partners who maintain operations of the firm and have full liability, whereas limited (silent) partners, who are often passive investors or otherwise not involved in day-to-day operations, enjoy limited liability. A limited liability partnership (LLP) is different from an LP.  In an LLP, partners are not exempt from liability for the debts of the partnership, but they may be exempt from liability for actions of other partners. A limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) is a relatively new business form that combines aspects of LPs and LLPs.

<b><i>Do Partnerships Pay Taxes\?</i></b>
The partnership itself does not pay business taxes. Instead, taxes are passed through to the individual partners to file on their own tax returns, often via a Schedule K.

<b><i>What Types of Businesses Are Best-Suited for Partnerships\?</i></b>
Partnerships are often best for a group of professionals in the same line of work where each partner has an active role in running the business. These often include medical professionals, lawyers, accountants, consultants, finance &amp; investing, and architects.</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics31">When you first launch your business, your main goal is to establish your brand and start growing. Unfortunately, this doesn\’t happen overnight. Growth is an ongoing process that requires hard work, patience and dedication. There\’s no special step or secret way to surpass other businesses in the industry or achieve immediate success.

There are, however, proven ways to reach growth milestones that can catapult a business to success. We asked small business leaders to share their tips for accelerating growth.

1. <b><i>Hire the right people.</i></b>
Before you can even think about your company\’s growth trajectory, you need to have a solid staff to help you achieve your goals.

\“Hiring the absolute best people you can is a surefire way to ensure fast growth,\” said Christian Lanng, CEO and co-founder of business software provider Tradeshift. \“It’s all about having the right team.\”

With hardworking employees dedicated to your company\’s success, your business will be better equipped for continued growth. In addition, delegating tasks to focus on important work will free up your time and energy, allowing you to perform at your best and cultivate a collaborative work culture.

2. <b><i>Focus on established revenue sources.</i></b>
Rather than trying to acquire new customers, direct your attention to the core customers you already have, suggested Bill Reilly, a Wisconsin-based auto repair entrepreneur. You can do this by implementing a referral or customer loyalty program or trying out marketing strategies based on previous purchasing behaviors to encourage repeat business, he said.

This focus on your established market is especially important if you\’re trying to get funding.

\“In the past, we would highlight our business goal to become a franchise, which didn\’t resonate with banks,\” Reilly said. \“We learned to emphasize that there is a large market for what we do. This would pique a banker\’s interest, because they care about the return on investment more than your business aspirations.\”

Tip: Maximize your current customer base by implementing a customer loyalty program or trying out marketing strategies based on customers\’ purchase histories.

3. <b><i>Reduce your risks.</i></b>
Risk is an inevitable part of starting and growing a business. It\’s impossible to control everything, but there are many ways to limit internal and external threats to your company and its growth. One important resource to help you accomplish this is your business insurance provider.

\“Small businesses need to manage their growth to avert disruptions that can bring business to a grinding halt\", said Mike DeHetre, vice president of product development at Travelers. For example, \“the theft of employee data, customer records, and product designs can destroy a small business, generating significant costs and eroding customer confidence and loyalty. Not every business owner\’s policy covers data breaches or other cyber losses. Small businesses should be prepared by seeking insurance products that help them recover, including those that cover the cost of remediation and lawsuits.\”

As your small business grows, you may add space or equipment, create new products or services, or increase your operating and distribution footprint, so DeHetre recommends periodically reviewing your policy to ensure you have the right coverage.

\“It\’s easy to forget this step amid rapid expansion, but you don\’t want to find out that you\’ve outgrown your coverage just when you need it the most,\” he said.

4. <b><i>Be adaptable.</i></b>
One trait that many successful startups have in common is the ability to switch directions quickly in response to changes in the market. Lanng said that an agile approach to development, both in your product and your company, will help you grow more quickly.

\“By allowing yourself to adapt and change quickly, you\’re able to test different approaches to business and find out what works best,\” Lanng told Business News Daily. \“It allows you to fail, pick yourself back up and keep going.\”

Chris Cornell, founder and CEO of Manhead Merchandise, said his company has found adaptability to be key in expanding its client base beyond its initial focus on music merchandise.

\“Look to current pop culture trends for an opportunity to become part of the movement when it makes sense,\” he said. \“In an era of internet fame, we looked to expand our horizons beyond the music industry. We partnered with \‘The King of Pop Culture\’ and Insta-famous pup, Doug the Pug, to release his new gear. Recognizing the reach and popularity of Doug, we were able to take his merchandise to the next level, extending our business model beyond bands.\”</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics32">5. <b><i>Focus on your customer experience.</i></b>
Customers\’ perceptions can make or break your business. Deliver quality experiences and products, and they\’ll quickly sing your praises on social media; mess it up, and they\’ll tell the world even faster. Fast growth depends on making your current and potential customers happy with their experience.

\“Compared with large companies, small businesses are nimble and often better able to see, anticipate, and respond to their customers\’ needs,\” DeHetre said. \“The most successful small businesses exploit this advantage by bringing new and innovative products and services to market more quickly and developing and nurturing long-term customer relationships.\”

Dennis Tanjeloff, president and CEO of Astro Gallery of Gems, agreed. He said listening to your customers and giving them what they want is of utmost importance. [Learn how customer relationship management software can help you better understand your customers.]

\“Diversify your offerings so you can best cater to the customers\’ changing tastes,\” Tanjeloff said. \“Remember, you are here to serve the customer – it\’s why you are open for business.\”

While engaging with your audience is crucial, personalizing the experience can boost and strengthen that relationship.

\“At Manhead, we come up with unique creative designs, customized storefronts, and pop-up shops personalized for each band [we work with] to help them engage with fans in a new way,\” Cornell said.

<u>Key Takeaway </u>: Small businesses can quickly adapt and respond to customers\’ needs. This agility can give them an advantage over larger businesses.

6. <b><i>Invest in yourself.</i></b>
In the early stages of your business, you\’ll likely see a very lean profit margin (or no profit at all), so any money you do make should go directly to helping you grow.

\“A startup\’s ability to invest in itself [helps] accelerate growth,\” Lanng said. \“In those early years, it\’s critical to make sure that you\’re redirecting any revenues back into the company. It\’s vital to invest early and heavily in order to grow quickly.\”

While it might be tempting to pocket all your profits, it\’s better to invest in your business\’s growth so you can reap bigger benefits later. Determine which parts of your business need more attention: For example, do you need to hire more workers, expand your marketing efforts, or secure additional funding\? When you find a crucial area that needs improvement, give that area your financial support.

7. <b><i>Always think ahead.</i></b>
While agility is an important quality for a startup, you can’t fly by the seat of your pants when you’re running a business. Planning your next step – in anticipation of all possible scenarios – is the best way to stay grounded and secure as your business evolves.

Thinking ahead is broad advice, but it can be as simple as reviewing all ongoing contracts, like comparing rates with the best credit card processors and seeing if you can negotiate a better deal.

8. <b><i>Boost your customer service.</i></b>
Another great method of growing your business is to focus on providing superior customer service. When you exceed customers\’ expectations, they are likely to tell their friends, family and followers about your business.

When you go the extra mile, such as by offering discounts if a customer has a poor experience or following up to ensure a client was satisfied with your product or service, you establish a reputation for great customer service. [Make sure you have the best business phone system for your customer service team.]

9. <b><i>Focus on social media.</i></b>
Another method to grow your business is to create profiles on all of the major social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.). An active profile allows you to better market your business and interact with far more potential customers.

When your business has an account that you update regularly on the major platforms, consumers can find your business more easily and are more likely to share your business with their friends. You\’ll also create a more engaging experience for your audience, helping them feel more connected to your brand and cultivating trust.

10. <b><i>Attend networking events.</i></b>
Networking events allow you to connect with like-minded individuals, many of whom have unique perspectives and insights that can help you grow your business. The connections and relationships that come from attending networking events can be beneficial for years to come.

11. <b><i>Practice corporate social responsibility.</i></b>
Consumers want to buy from businesses passionate about causes that help make the world a better place. Whether you donate to cancer research or support a nonprofit such as a homeless shelter, look for ways to contribute meaningfully to the causes you support and share that with your customers.

You could publicly express your support to underserved communities, donate to various organizations, offer your time to fundraisers, and offer sustainable products to help the environment. There are many ways to be socially responsible as a business; find a few that work for you.

12. <b><i>Host local events.</i></b>
While attending events is a great way to grow your network, hosting your own events within your community is even more beneficial – whether it\’s running a fundraiser, offering exclusive deals on a holiday, or sponsoring a local sports team. Creating a unique experience for your customers will foster more personal relationships with them.

If you host events in your area, you\’ll increase brand awareness and show your community that you are invested in their wellbeing. When you are committed to them, they\’ll feel more loyalty to your business.

13. <b><i>Research your competitors.</i></b>
While this might not elicit immediate growth, researching your competitors is one of the most important first steps in launching your business. Ask yourself who your competitors are, what they\’re doing (that you\’re not doing) that works for them, and how you can differentiate your business from theirs. The answers to these questions will help you form a more productive business strategy, defining the areas of your business that require more attention to flourish.</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics41"><i>Here are five ways working capital can work for your business</i>:\n\n
1. <b><i>Improving cash flow</i></b>
Business comes with its share of highs and lows for both start-ups and established enterprises. However, for businesses to thrive in either environment optimising working capital is a must. Maintaining a steady stream of liquidity ensures enterprises are sustainable and meet basic needs such as hold necessary inventory, pay salaries, rent, utilities, and mortgage payments on time. It also allows for surplus cash to be reinvested in scaling up the business.

Working capital financing facilitates entrepreneurs with perpetual access to capital and helps optimize cash flows while investing in the company\’s growth.

2. <b><i>Capitalising seasonal swings</i></b>
Several businesses are cyclical wherein the business doubles or triples in certain months like festive periods or summers. While businesses are keen on capitalising these seasonal upswings, they are always worried about the severe working capital crunch, holding them back from taking up larger orders.

Working capital financing can help bridge this gap and equip businesses to leverage the increase in demand without adding stress to financials. Tata Capital offers peak limit activation for its working capital borrowers to accommodate seasonal fluctuations in the business without any additional documentation.</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics42">3. <b><i>Improving creditworthiness</i></b>
Financiers and prospective customers look at robust working capital balance as one of the critical indicators of financial health or creditworthiness in any company. Maintaining good creditworthiness can also open up access to higher amounts of business financing and better interest rates. If used prudently, working capital financing can reflect how well an organization manages its operations.

4. <b><i>Navigating Crisis</i></b>
Every business comes with its risk, and no better time than the pandemic to reinstate how uncertain and susceptible companies are to economic fluctuations. Working capital financing can help navigate an unprecedented crisis by providing enough cushion to manage essential expenditures to keep the business afloat. If you are currently facing a financial crunch with the pandemic, don\’t hesitate to reach out to Services like Tata Capital for additional support.

5. <b><i>Facilitate Growth </i></b>
One of the biggest challenges small businesses face is the lack of access to working capital at competitive rates to facilitate their growth. Access to working capital enables scaling up the business to its true potential while providing room for a margin of error. Companies with additional working capital have the freedom to take on larger orders from their customers without impacting their current fulfilling capabilities. It also ensures accurate financial forecasting that helps entrepreneurs make well-informed choices and accelerate growth.</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics51">Stage 1: <b><i>Concept and Research</i></b>
It seems everybody has (what they consider) a million-dollar idea, but making an idea into reality is very rare. Rarer still is the \“great idea\” that not only gets off the ground, but finds its perfect audience. A huge factor in a start-up\’s success comes before the company itself ever launches. Before you do anything else, carefully research your target audience and your offering\’s potential product-market fit Do people really need your product or service\? What problem does your offering solve\? Is your idea already out there, being sold by an existing company\? Answering these questions entails a lot of research into your potential competition and industry, but it also takes talking to hypothetical customers about how your offering might help them. Research in hand, create a business plan and mission statement. Set goals for your development over the coming years.

Stage 2: <b><i>Commitment</i></b>
Here\’s where you move from a concept to a company, putting your research into practice. Create a prototype, develop a process, and start building a team. Secure funding. Continue to refine your business model. Work towards a minimum viable product, begin initial marketing to drum up some word of mouth, then launch.

Stage 3: <b><i>Traction</i></b>
Traction, or validation, is typically the first year of a start-up. This is the stage where you begin to get the word out about your product and gain your first customers. Here you find out whether or not your company is truly viable. \“Before their companies start to grow, most entrepreneurs mistake traction for growth. Both come at different stages in the lifecycle of the startup and play very different roles,\” says Varshneya. At this stage, focus on growing your customer base and actually attaining the product-market fit you researched earlier.

Stage 4: <b><i>Refinement</i></b>
In the refinement stage, typically year 2, you are receiving—and soliciting—feedback from early adopters, then using that feedback to continue refining your product or service. How can you improve your offering\? What about your customer experience\? Concentrate on expanding the aspects of your product that are most beneficial to customers. Your early interactions with customers go a long way toward establishing your credibility and building customer trust. Show that you are taking customers\’ concerns into account as you continue to develop your offering. Refinement also means refining your process, making it more efficient. How can you streamline your process\? Are there parts of the workflow you can cut out altogether\? Is product performance matching your projections, and if not, where is it getting derailed\? Test your strategies and track conversion rates, social media analytics, and any other data you can to inform your decisions.</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics52">Stage 5: <b><i>Scaling</i></b>
The next stage of a startup is scaling, or growing—further growing your customer base, your offerings, and your company itself. In this stage, which can start at year 2 to 3 and last for years, you iterate on what\’s working and put processes into place to iterate faster. Continue optimizing your marketing strategies to efficiently pull in customers and increase your conversion rates. Build out your staff and infrastructure to support your growing workload. For the smoothest scaling up, build scaling mechanisms into your business plan from the beginning. How and when will you hire more employees\? How will you expand your marketing\? What about growing your physical premises and technological infrastructure\? Keep in mind, however, that you\’ll need to stay agile as you grow—the process can be unpredictable. Like refinement, scaling requires considerable awareness about your process. As a founder, this likely means limiting or delegating any non-essential tasks you are performing. \“While scaling up, there may be many tasks on a daily or weekly basis that hold you back or slow you down,\” advises Varshneya. \“While scaling up, you want to channel all your focus on just one thing—growth.\”

Stage 6: <b><i>Becoming Established</i></b>
Congratulations—your company is no longer a start-up, but an established enterprise. In this stage (likely year 3 or after), you may see considerable growth, although not at the dramatic rate you did while scaling up. Focus on increasing customer retention and loyalty, testing and refining your marketing strategies, and further developing your strengths.

<u>What You Need to Know to Make the Most of Each Startup Stage</u>
Of the 6 stages of a startup, which stage of start-up growth best describes your business\’s current incarnation\? Wherever you are on the start-up timeline, keep these tips in mind as you work toward the next.

Be patient. Regardless of where your start-up falls in the stages of development,  it can be difficult to fully embrace that stage without wanting to jump ahead. \nResist the temptation to cut corners. \nEach stage needs to play out fully…which may take years.
Remember that every company is unique. \nComparing your progress to other start-ups\’ trajectories can be productive—to a point—if you are learning from their mistakes and triumphs. \nBut take care that this comparison is inspiring you, rather than dragging you down.
Keep your customers at the center of everything you do. \nYour customers\’ needs and experience are all-important; after all, without customers, your company can\’t survive.</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics61"><b><u>Why is budgeting important for startup success\?</u></b>
You probably know that developing a startup budget does more than just prevent financial mishaps. It helps in making well-planned and informed financial decisions, which is why it is often regarded as the most important step in running a business. As a startup owner, there are a lot more reasons you need to allot time for budgeting. Let me run you through some:

- Provides an idea on when to recruit employees.
- With a regular budget, you can finance to scale by using real-time business data. This avoids early fundraising and over-borrowing.
- A better estimation of your break-even point so you know exactly when to adjust necessary variables.
- Making predictions of cash shortfalls becomes more accurate so you can line up funds accordingly.
- Generate precise financial statements to share with investors or lenders.

<i>What are the types of startup budget\?</i>
Now that you know why a budget is so crucial to the success of your business, let\’s see what options you can choose from. Although there are many variations to the kinds of budgets you can adopt, there are 2 main kinds:

1. <b><i>One-Year Budget</i></b>
This type is used to forecast weekly, monthly, and even daily expenses. A suitable method of doing this is by preparing a rolling budget and P&amp;L. Since your business is highly dynamic (that\’s a compliment), managing your risks has to be done in a timely fashion. When you are starting out, try to have a short-interval rolling budget that is updated consistently annually. That being said, strive to have a monthly or quarterly budget to plan for the future.

2. <b><i>Long-Duration Budget</i></b>
A budget that spans over 3 or 5 years enables you to visualize your long term financial goals. I know you\’re wondering how you can set specific aims when you\’re in the initial phase. But, hear me out. A long term budget does not have to have particular assumptions, however, outline the overall objectives against appropriate references. For example, to estimate a 5-year revenue model, you can benchmark it against predictions of the 5-year industry growth trends. Stay updated with expected inflations, percentage rises, etc.</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics62"><b>7 Easy Steps to create a startup budget</b>
I took you through the standard practices on how budgeting can benefit your business strategies. You don\’t have to estimate your costs right down to the cent or predict the future perfectly to create a useful budget. What is important is that you forecast numbers based on competitor analysis, market research, or vender quotes.

The important thing to remember is to be cautious when it comes to your projections. A golden rule to follow would be to underestimate revenue and overestimate expenses. Don\’t reverse the rule, it won\’t go well. Let\’s go through the full-fledged ways in which you can begin developing your startup budget.

1. <b><i>Set a target</i></b>
While you\’re reading this, grab a book, computer, any tool that you usually use. A lot of people underrate the importance of collating data and analyzing results when it comes to budgeting. Tools such as Google Sheets, MS Excel, accounting software, are great for integrated financial planning. Take your time to figure out what layout and timeline you’re looking at. Make a habit of entering sample values to test computerized formulas. This will avoid hours of data entry only to realize the calculations don\’t work.

Next, set an upfront goal that will help you differentiate between the \‘must-haves\’ and the \‘would-be-nice-to-haves.\’ Do not forget to factor in an emergency fund within your startup budget. This should include a minimum of 3 months\’ expenses at any given time. You\’ll thank me later.

2. <b><i>List income sources </i></b>
While developing a budget, it is important to know where your cash may flow in from. One effective way to calculate your earnings is by using customer personas to approximate their purchasing frequency. You can also differentiate prospects by region, expected conversions, etc. A good CRM software really helps you do this. Another way to go about this is to estimate your break-even results. Always be mindful of being realistic when calculating potential revenue or funding sources such as loans, savings, or investment income. Have a discussion with your sales and marketing teams to narrow down projects to take up. Always add a lump sum to this predicted amount for new opportunities. Make sure that everything you list down is justifiable and realistic.

3. <b><i>Categorize costs into revenue buckets</i></b>
Categorizing costs can be tricky but I have a simple method to make things easier. Divide your costs into Capital and Operational Expenditure. The former includes any large investments such as land areas, equipment, etc. These costs give you returns several times.

Often, you may have to do a knee-deep analysis of current versus future investments. While doing so, ensure that you mention any and all financial information associated with each project phase. This will force your capital spending to align with your long term financial goals.

While we\’re at it, let\’s take a deeper look into \‘how much of your budget should be payroll\?\’

Allocating percentages of your gross revenue for payroll varies according to the kind of business you have. For example, the restaurant industry averages around 30 percent labour costs. If you are into retail, labour expenses will tend to be at 10-20 percent. For most service-based industries, payroll falls under the primary cost. This means that up to 50 percent of your revenue will go into payroll without destroying profitability. In general terms, a safe zone for your business is payroll costs that fall between 15-30 percent of your revenue.

At Asanify, we help startups and SMEs budget better especially for their payroll. Get started today for free.

4. <b><i>Determine variable costs</i></b>
As the term suggests, these expenses fluctuate with your sales and production. The most common examples of variable costs include:

- Raw Materials
- Advertising expenditure
- Shipping
- Freelance services
- Utilities, etc.
- Whlle you can request quotes from contractors and manufacturers for a lot of these costs, remember to consider how time and season may affect these as well. General &amp; Administrative, as well as travel costs, also fall under this category. You can estimate these on past data but as I said, make quantifiable assumptions for everything. Once you have your fixed and variable costs more or less decided upon, do a quick round-up to make your startup budget realistic.

Note: I would love it if your business did well, but when it does, these costs will also go up. So you will need to find creative ways to reduce your startup costs.

5. <b><i>Accommodate Interest and Taxes</i></b>
While I hope this does not hold true for you, if you have a debt, you need to pay up interest. On the other hand, having a large cash balance will get you interest income.

You will also need to budget for annual taxes, which may be different across state locations. If you are faced with net operating losses, understand that they may be from previous losses. Ensure that you accommodate for these factors before setting a target.

6. <b><i>Create estimates for financial statements</i></b>
This is critical for a startup during your budgeting process. You may be tempted to project only for your P&amp;L along with the capital expenditure. But take a step ahead, approximate for your balance sheet along with P&amp;L for a comprehensive cash flow estimation. When you do this, you will know how much funding you really need. Map out your assets/liabilities so that you never have to face delayed or absence of funding.

When I say integration, this is what I mean: Run your entire budget by everyone involved in the team. Sales, HR, R&amp;D, department heads, and top management. As a startup, you want to make sure that your budgeting strategy makes sense in the real world. For easy business growth, give budgeting the importance it demands through intra-organization discussions.

 <b>How to tackle startup budgeting challenges\?</b>
It\’s no surprise that a process like budgeting can be quite daunting. You can face various problems while drawing up a startup budget right from sticking to the budget to a lack of capital.
Let\’s look at the most common challenges you may face and how to overcome them.

1. <b><i>Reduced Cash Flow</i></b>
This is one of the major challenges for most small business owners. It really doesn\’t matter how many assets you may have, if you have no cash, your business is done for. To maintain operations, you have to pay business taxes, manage invoices along with recurring expenses such as payroll and rent.

One way to work around this issue is to streamline your payment processes. Set up online portals or accept payments through GooglePay or Paytm. Sending your clients automated payment reminders can ensure they follow your schedule. For clients who are known to pay late, think up ways to incentivize them like small discounts.

Regardless of the option you pick, ensure that you pay off your full balance every month. Incurring interest on your business credit cards is a definite no-go.

2. <b><i>Deviation from budget</i></b>
We did a comprehensive check on what goes into developing a startup budget. Now, you must stick to it. Follow the steps mentioned in the previous sections to review your budgets annually. This way, you can compare results versus predictions and know exactly what is happening when. STAY REALISTIC and look at all your income sources to get a picture of what you are working with. Don\’t leave anything out, include all your sales, investment revenues and other account receivables. An important tip is to schedule monthly budget reviews so you\’re on track. When you know where you stand, you can make smarter financial decisions.

3. <b><i>Unexpected Expenses</i></b>
This is the best time to talk about unexpected expenses courtesy of COVID-19. When I said allocate some money for an emergency fund for every monthly or quarterly budget, this is what I was implying. It is always good to look at past records to better understand future spending. Try to figure out how you can incur minimal financial stress to maintain the pace of the budget. Ask yourself questions like \‘How much can I increase my sales in the coming months\?\’ or \‘Can I reduce marketing expenses\?.\’ It is clear that at some point, there will be unforeseen expenses, but the better you are equipped, the less you will be affected.

<b><u>Conclusion</u></b>
As with every process, budgeting is key if you want to have a successful startup business. We\’ve covered the need for a startup to have a stable budget after which we took a brief look at the types of budgets you can opt for. Then we got extensive insights into the steps you should take to develop a startup budget.

    <string name="string_startupBasics71">The following pages will help you understand what cash flow is, how it impacts profits, and tips on how to improve your cash flow.

<b>Cash Flow Basics</b>\n\n

<u><b>What is cash flow\?</b></u> It\'s basically the movement of funds in and out of your business. You should be tracking this either weekly, monthly or quarterly. There are essentially two kinds of cash flows:

• <b><i>Positive cash flow</i></b>: This occurs when the cash funneling into your business from sales, accounts receivable, etc. is more than the amount of the cash leaving your businesses through accounts payable, monthly expenses, salaries, etc.

• <b><i>Negative cash flow</i></b>: This occurs when your outflow of cash is greater than your incoming cash. This generally spells trouble for a business, but there are steps you can take to remedy the situation and generate or collect more cash while maintaining or cutting expenses.

Achieving a positive cash flow does not come by chance. You have to work at it. You need to analyze and manage your cash flow to more effectively control the inflow and outflow of cash. The SBA recommends undertaking cash flow analysis to make sure you have enough cash each month to cover your obligations in the coming month. The SBA has a free cash flow worksheet you can use. In addition, most accounting software packages geared to small or mid-sized businesses – such as Quickbooks will help you produce a cash flow statement. There are also other websites offering free templates, including Winsmark Business Solutions and Office Depot.

<b><i>Profit versus Cash Flow</i></b>

Profit does not equal cash flow. You can\'t just look at your profit and loss statement (P&amp;L) and get a grip on your cash flow. Many other financial figures feed into factoring your cash flow, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, capital expenditures, and debt service. Smart cash-flow management requires a laser focus on each of these drivers of cash, in addition to your profit or loss. \"There is a secret that very few business owners have discovered (and the accounting community has not done a good job revealing): knowing whether you earned a profit (or created a loss) is not the same as knowing what happened to your cash,\" Campbell says. \"Profit, as defined by the rules of accounting, is simply revenue minus expenses. Invoicing a customer for products or services you sold to them creates revenue. Actually collecting the money on that invoice is what creates cash.\"

A positive cash flow is actually needed to generate profits. You need enough cash to pay your employees and suppliers so that you can make goods. It\'s the sale of those goods that helps generate a profit. But if you don\'t have the money to make the goods, you don\'t end up with the profit. So you really need to structure your business to have a positive cash flow if you want your business to grow and increase profits.

\"Growing your business puts a huge strain on cash,\" Campbell says. \"You almost always have to make investments and bring certain expenses on ahead of achieving the higher revenue and cash flow that comes with successful growth. Maybe you want to open an office in a new city so you can build the business there. Or, you need to build a new facility so you have the capacity to sell to larger customers. Those scenarios (and others) require cash up front.\"</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics72"><b><i>How to Improve Cash Flow</i></b>

Most business owners see growth as the solution to a cash-flow problem. That\'s why they often achieve their goal of growing the business only to find they have increased their cash-flow problems in the process. Plan for growth and the related cash outlays in advance, so they do not come as a surprise. In the meantime, the SBA recommends that you take the following practical steps to better manage cash flow, especially for the growing business:

• <b><i>Collecting receivables</i></b> - To speed up the receipt and processing of receivables, the SBA suggests several steps. Spring for a lockbox service, post office boxes serviced by banks so that customers in far flung locations can mail payments there and the checks will be processed by the banks more quickly. Ask customers to preauthorize checks so that banks can draw against their accounts at timed intervals. Centralize your banking at one bank. Ask customers to pay with depository transfer checks, a relatively cheap fund transfer. You can also try offering discounts to customers if they pay bills quickly.

• <b><i>Tightening credit requirements</i></b> - Businesses often have to extend credit to customers, particularly when starting out or growing. But you have to do your research beforehand to determine the risk of extending credit to each customer. Can they pay their bills on time\? Is their business growing or faltering\? Are they having cash-flow problems\? The SBA recommends getting a Dun &amp; Bradstreet report on potential customers and asking them to fill out a credit application. You should also check references. Another option to extending store credit is to accept credit cards. This will cost you a percentage, generally from 2 to 5 percent of the sale, but it may be a safer bet for getting paid on time.

• <b><i>Increasing sales</i></b> - If you need more cash, it seems like a no brainer to go out and try to attract new customers or sell additional goods or services to your existing customers. But this may be easier said than done. New customer acquisition is essential to a growing business, but it can take time and money to convert prospects into sales. Selling more to existing customers is cheaper and you may be able to do this by analyzing what they\'re buying and why - information that may even lead you to increase your profit margin and, hopefully, generate more cash. But the SBA warns businesses to be careful when increasing sales because you may just increase your accounts receivables and not actual cash if these sales are on credit.

• <b><i>Pricing discounts</i></b> - One option to increasing cash flow is to offer your customers discounts if they pay early. While this practice may impact your profit margin, it may help your management of cash flow by incentivizing customers to make payments earlier than billing cycles typically require. Your company may also take advantage of this with suppliers and others that you owe, but be careful that your early payments of debt don\'t leave you with a cash flow shortfall.

• <b><i>Securing loans</i></b> - Short-term cash flow problems may sometimes necessitate a business taking out a loan from a financial institution. Some possible types are revolving credit lines or equity loans, according to the SBA. Most of the time this type of borrowing accomplishes its goals, although during the financial crisis many banks were canceling credit lines and calling in loans. Another option is a long-term amortized loan which includes interest and principal until the loan is paid off.

<i>Getting Control of Your Cash Flow</i>

Campbell suggests asking yourself the following two questions to get a sense about whether you have your business\' cash flow situation under control:

1. <b><i>What is my cash balance right now\?</i></b>

2. <b><i>What do I expect my cash balance to be six months from now\?</i></b>

\"If you can\'t answer these two questions, then strap yourself in for a wild ride,\" he says. \"You are on a roller coaster ride that\'s about to become really frightening. You don\'t have your cash flow under control.\"

One way to keep that situation under control is by tracking your cash flow results every month to determine if your management is creating the type of cash flow your business needs. This also helps you get better and better at creating cash flow projections you can rely on as you make business decisions about expanding your business and taking care of your existing bills.</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics81">
In order to effectively manage and run a successful organization, leadership must guide their employees and develop problem-solving techniques. Finding a suitable solution for issues can be accomplished by following the basic four-step problem-solving process and methodology outlined below.

<i>Step - Characteristics</i>\n
1. <b><i>Define the problem	</i></b>
\t- Differentiate fact from opinion
\t- Specify underlying causes
\t- Consult each faction involved for information
\t- State the problem specifically
\t- Identify what standard or expectation is violated
\t- Determine in which process the problem lies
\t- Avoid trying to solve the problem without data\n
2. <b><i>Generate alternative solutions	</i></b>
\t- Postpone evaluating alternatives initially
\t- Include all involved individuals in the generating of alternatives
\t- Specify alternatives consistent with organizational goals
\t- Specify short- and long-term alternatives
\t- Brainstorm on others\' ideas
\t- Seek alternatives that may solve the problem\n
3. <b><i>Evaluate and select an alternative	</i></b>
\t- Evaluate alternatives relative to a target standard
\t- Evaluate all alternatives without bias
\t- Evaluate alternatives relative to established goals
\t- Evaluate both proven and possible outcomes
\t- State the selected alternative explicitly\n
4. <b><i>Implement and follow up on the solution</i></b>
\t- Plan and implement a pilot test of the chosen alternative
\t- Gather feedback from all affected parties
\t- Seek acceptance or consensus by all those affected
\t- Establish ongoing measures and monitoring
\t- Evaluate long-term results based on final solution\n\n

</string>
    <string name="string_startupBasics82">1.\n\n\n<u>Define the problem</u>
        Diagnose the situation so that your focus is on the problem, not just its symptoms. Helpful problem-solving techniques include using flowcharts to identify the expected steps of a process and cause-and-effect diagrams to define and analyze root causes.

The sections below help explain key problem-solving steps. These steps support the involvement of interested parties, the use of factual information, comparison of expectations to reality, and a focus on root causes of a problem. You should begin by:

Reviewing and documenting how processes currently work (i.e., who does what, with what information, using what tools, communicating with what organizations and individuals, in what time frame, using what format).
Evaluating the possible impact of new tools and revised policies in the development of your \"what should be\" model.\n\n
2. <u>Generate alternative solutions</u>
Postpone the selection of one solution until several problem-solving alternatives have been proposed. Considering multiple alternatives can significantly enhance the value of your ideal solution. Once you have decided on the \"what should be\" model, this target standard becomes the basis for developing a road map for investigating alternatives. Brainstorming and team problem-solving techniques are both useful tools in this stage of problem solving.

Many alternative solutions to the problem should be generated before final evaluation. A common mistake in problem solving is that alternatives are evaluated as they are proposed, so the first acceptable solution is chosen, even if it\’s not the best fit. If we focus on trying to get the results we want, we miss the potential for learning something new that will allow for real improvement in the problem-solving process.\n\n
3. <u>Evaluate and select an alternative</u>
Skilled problem solvers use a series of considerations when selecting the best alternative. They consider the extent to which:

- A particular alternative will solve the problem without causing other unanticipated problems.
- All the individuals involved will accept the alternative.
- Implementation of the alternative is likely.
- The alternative fits within the organizational constraints.\n\n
4. <u>Implement and follow up on the solution</u>
Leaders may be called upon to direct others to implement the solution, \"sell\" the solution, or facilitate the implementation with the help of others. Involving others in the implementation is an effective way to gain buy-in and support and minimize resistance to subsequent changes.

Regardless of how the solution is rolled out, feedback channels should be built into the implementation. This allows for continuous monitoring and testing of actual events against expectations. Problem solving, and the techniques used to gain clarity, are most effective if the solution remains in place and is updated to respond to future changes.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv22">\n\nWell, for high technology startups today, <i>Independent Survival</i> is not really a sustainable situation because it provides little or no return to the outside investors. \n\nHuge cash investments are typically required today to develop the technology and accelerate the company along the route quickly enough to take a market leadership position and make it to IPO. \nOf course, a private business can distribute profits by paying dividends to shareholders, but it would likely to take years, even decades for investors to recover the cash they injected to fund the up-front research and development costs a technology company \n- and even longer for them to see a positive return on investment.</string>
    <string name="string_lcztoaiv23">\nWithout an <b>exit route</b>, these companies are likely the <b><i>\'living dead\'</i></b> — the company is living but the stock is dead. \n\nNot Surprisingly your\'e unlikely to find any investors today that are prepared to sit around for years patiently waiting for their annual dividend checks --- sooner or later theyr\'e going to push the board to seek a <i>Cash Flow Sale</i> or <i>IPO</i>. \n\nAlthough it may be appealing to service companies, low-tech sector companies and small mom and pop operations that are free of outside investors, independent survival is not a viable destination for technology startups.\n\nIt is, however, a great place to hang out for a little while before you push ahead with a sale of the company or IPO.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv31"><i>OK, I have a twisted mind, but when I think of the Journey from <i>Zero To IPO</i>, I imagine an island surrounded by <b>Shark-infested seas</b>— see the maps below.</i>\n\nThe challenge is to take your StartUp from <i>Zero To IPO</i>, <i>Cash Flow Sale</i> or <i>Asset Sale</i>.</string>
    <string name="string_lcztoaiv32">The fastest and safest way of Reaching your destination is to stick to the Route.\nHowever, the path is very narrow and it\'s easy to wander off course.

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv41">\n<i>Many people flooded into Silicon Valley in recent years, especially in the dot-com gold rush years, but technology entrepreneurs are not the first people to head West in search of a better life. People have been migrating West for as long as anyone can remember-and there are things that we can learn from their experiences.</i>\n\nToday\'s companies are drawn by the nurturing business environment and the skilled workforce of <b>Silicon Valley</b>. \n\nIn the last century, good weather and farming and was enough to entice people to embark on a dangerous westward journey.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv42">Back then, the challenge was to find a good road map, select a route and travel plans that would enable you to get your family through the mountains before the winter storms arrived. Some people made it through without a scratch, others were not so lucky.\n The lucky travelers had survived by eating the flesh of the other, less fortunate, members of the party and that when they were discovered they were actually broiling and preparing the body parts of close family members for a juicy meal.</string>


    <string name="string_lcztoaiv43">When we look back at the story of the Donner Party today it\'s difficult to understand how they could have been so foolish as to find themselves trapped in such an inhospitable place mid-winter without appropriate supplies. They embarked on the journey thinking that if they could just get over the mountains they\'d find a land of milk and honey in California. Of course actual cannibalism is quite rare (or well covered up) in corporate America today but many of the journeys taken by technology startups end in similarly ugly conditions and there\'s a great deal to be learned from the journeys of our adventurous forefathers.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv51">\n<i>Surely with a little planning, each member of the Donner Party should have been able to make it through without having to snack out on the body parts of family and friends in deed many other parties had successfully completed the journey before.</i>\n\n Wouldn\'t you like to have the opportunity of advising the leaders of the <b>Donner Party</b> before they set out on their fateful journey\? \n\nAs a modern traveler your advice could likely be summarized as follows:</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv52">Target your destination-make sure you know precisely where you\'re going. If you don\'t, what chance do you have of ever getting there\? Pick your team-choose team members that are headed to the same destination and are prepared to pull their weight on the journey. Oh yes try to avoid cannibals, especially if there\'s a possibility that provisions may run low. You want a team that\'s prepared to back itself and is more interested in stock options than salary. Plot your course-get hold of the best map you can and select a course that doesn\'t go through snowy mountains in mid-winter. Identify all the steps and milestones that you\'re going to need to hit along the way.</string>


    <string name="string_lcztoaiv53">Gather your provisions-prepare a comprehensive list of everything that you\'re going to need to complete each stage of the journey. Make sure you can make it to the next staging post with food to spare! Maintain your momentum-keep the wagons rolling. Take yor bearing-regularly check and cross-check where you are against the map to avoid straying off course.\n\nPrepare for contingencies - carry extra food, clothing and shelter, just in case you get trapped by a snow storm. Should the snows come in, plan to send a party out on foot in search of help the moment the wagons grind to a halt.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv61">\n<i>In the good old days, you could set out with a simple mission to design a great product and build a profitable private business-you didn\'t have to think about whether this would lead to a subsequent sale of the company or IPO.</i> \n\nToday, facing <b>fierce competition</b>, huge startup costs and fast moving markets, this is no longer possible if you don\'t target your destination and drive directly toward it at full speed, you have little or no hope of getting there before the competition.</string>
    <string name="string_lcztoaiv62">Your investors are going to want to see a clear exit route where their shares convert back to cash and they get to receive a return on investment-designing a great product and building a good business no longer sufficient reward.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv63">Targeting your destination is a core component of your travel plan-if you don\'t know where you\'re going what chance do you have of ever getting there\? It\'s not a guarantee of success though-even the Donner Party had a destination in mind when they set out, and their journey didn\'t exactly end in idyllic conditions. Once you\'ve targeted your destination you can plot your route, pick your team and start to generate some momentum.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv71">\n<i>Do you remember those long arduous road trips with friends and family members that seemed to get more irritating the longer the journey went on\? We\'ve all had them. Tempers fray when previously friendly traveling companions grow tired and irritable especially when the trip doesn\'t go smoothly and the party fails to reach its chosen destination on schedule.</i> \n\nI recently read that scientists have figured out that putting several <b>astronauts into a space ship</b> <i>for a mission</i> <u>that could take several years</u> would create the perfect conditions for murder.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv72">Bear this in mind when you pick your founding partners, investors, executives, directors, advisors, managers, bankers, lawyers, accountants, consultants, suppliers, contractors and employees for this long and arduous road trip: Pick traveling companions that all target the same destination-if there\'s any disagreement about where the party is headed, you\'re definitely in for trouble sooner or later. Avoid cannibals-pick personality types that support the team and don\'t cannibalize their own team members when the going gets tough.\n Pick good navigators-people that can read maps, take bearings to fix your position and help plot out the best route forward can be worth their weight in gold.</string>
    <string name="string_lcztoaiv73">Avoid traveling companions that want a chauffeur-driven imo service-pick the candidates that are prepared to walk, run, climb, jump or do whatever it takes to make progress on the journey. Pick team members that can help identify the provisions the team is going to meed and helps gather them together-avoid the person that would steal the last cookie, deny stealing it and wait for someone else to buy more Keep your team as small as possible as large teams are very difficult to control and keep headed in the same direction. Pick people that know the route-the practical experience of seasoned travelers can be invaluable.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv81">\n<i>The Magic of Positive Momentum In business it\'s momentum that attracts customers, investors, employees and other members of the team. People like to be associated with the Company when they hear the buzz and feel the  enthusiasm-everyone wants to be part of a success story.</i>\n\n <b><u>Positive Momentum</u></b>\n - In the context of your startup, positive momentum is the invisible force that thrusts the company forward toward it\'s chosen destination. Momentum is evidenced by the company\'s progress its repeated achievement of milestones and stepping stones.\n\t<b><i>Positive momentum</i></b> is generated by, and somewhat synonymous with, a collective sense of <b><i>approval, enthusiasm, excitement and passion</i></b> in favor of the company and its products, an upbeat buzz or hype emanating from the company\'s insiders, customers, press and other respected independent outsiders. \n\nEnthusiasm is contagious and positive momentum creates more positive momentum.\n\n<b>Positive momentum</b> comes from an upbeat team making marked progress along its chosen route. Evidence of the progress makes the team more enthusiastic and energetic, helping the company to achieve more milestones and stepping stones at an accelerated rate in a cycle of progress.\n\n</string>
    <string name="string_lcztoaiv82">Negative Momentum Negative momentum is the force that prevents the company from generating traction or making progress towards its target destination. Evidenced by a lack of achievement, or a backwards step, negative momentum features a pessimistic opinion of the company, it\'s products and/or its prospects in the market. Unchecked, negative momentum accelerates into a free fall as word gets out that thecompany is in trouble and team members bail out. The company has no momentum when it fails to achieve its milestones and stepping stones. The team gets despondent when it fails to see any evidence of progress. If they feel that the company has no plan and no future, the employees spend their time polishing their resumes instead of building products or closing sales-paralysis sets in and the whole operation grinds to a halt.


The despondency deepens as key team members bail out. Soon, word spreads to
customers, competitors, journalists and the company\'s troubles become public
knowledge. Instead of people being attracted towards the company, they suddenly
want to distance themselves as far away from it as they can. Like any stampede,
people get knocked down and trampled on the way out.
Loss of momentum is the most dangerous threat to survival for many distressed
companies. In conjunction with a developing cash crisis, negative momentum often
develops into free fall momentum that can be very difficult to escape.</string>
    <string name="string_lcztoaiv83">Spread the Good Vibes
Companies at all stages of growth can boost momentum by spreading the good
vibes. Steve Jobs used to regularly send out propaganda e-mails to friends,
colleagues and virtually every e-mail address he could lay his hands on. It has since
become a management feature for virtually all successful startups. En-route to a
spectacularly successful dot-com IP0, my friend became a master of momentum
sending out good vibe press releases on a daily basis and whipping his team into a
frenzy of excitement.\n\n
Five tips for Spreading the Good Vibes:\n
1. Maintain your own level of enthusiasm — team leaders need to stay upbeat
regardless of whether they\'re having a bad hair day.\n
2. Maintain a general level of excitement in the team (at all cost)-feel-good beer busts,
gatherings and social events can help boost morale. Any employee that
persistently keeps spreading bad vibes by shouting (or whispering) \'we\'re all
doomed, we\'re all going to die or \'our competitors are going to kill us\', needs
to be taken out as quickly as possible.\n
3. Look for good news and spread it-evidence of marked progress is ideal, but even
small wins are worth getting excited about.\n
4. Don\'t hide from bad news, but don\'t dwell on it if there\'s bad news, show that you
acknowledge it and move on.\n
5. Expose the passionate people to as many as you can-momentum is contagious.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv91">\n<i>In taking your bearings, you\'re really checking to see if there\'s sufficient reason to
change your current course</i>:\n\n
\t <b><i>Are any obstacles blocking your route\?</i></b>\n
\t <b><i>Is anything blocking the company from
hitting one of its upcoming stepping stones or milestones\?</i></b> \n
\t <b><i>Is the obstacle insurmountable or can it be overcome\?</i></b>\n
\t <b><i>Is the route still open\?</i></b>\n- Poor weather conditions on Wall Street often lead to
the closure of the route to IPO.\n
\t <b><i>Have any of your contingencies been triggered\?</i></b>\nIn preparing your travel plan you
identified certain events and situations that would require changes to your
route.\n
\t <b><i>Do yon have sufficient momentum\?</i></b>\n- Are you hitting the milestones and making
marked progress along your chosen course\?\n
\t <b><i>Are you beading for a cash flow crisis\?</i></b>\n-averting a cash crisis is a priority activity!\n</string>
    <string name="string_lcztoaiv92">Taking your Bearings in 2 Simple Steps
With an accurate map, a cash flow forecast and details of the company\'s progress
and achievements, the process of pinpointing your position takes just two simple
steps:\n
1. Mark your progress-check off the milestones and stepping stones
achieved. Identify obstacles that could block your progress.
Identify whether you\'re on track or on the slippery slope heading for a\n
2. Cash crisis-compare your cash flow forecast with the status of your
fundraising efforts. Be realistic hereit can be dangerous to rely only on a
best case scenario.</string>
    <string name="string_lcztoaiv93">When to Take your Bearings
At a minimum, you need to take your bearings and provide a status report for
inclusion in the board package that\'s mailed out to the directors a few days ahead of
each board meeting. A quarterly navigation check may be sufficient if you\'re on
track-hitting your milestones with plenty of cash in the bank. However, as a cash
crisis develops it becomes increasingly important to pinpoint your position on a
regular basis monthly or even weekly if you reach the survival and free fall zones.</string>

    <string name="string_lcztoaiv101">\n<i>The starting point of the seven point travel plan is to target your destination if you
don\'t know where you\'re going you have little chance of actually getting there. Of
course it is possible to embark on a journey without targeting a specific
destination-people do it all the time. They\'re the people that never really get
anywhere-you see them every day aimlessly wandering around with no sense of
purpose or direction.</i> \n\nMercifully, the laws of natural selection and survival of the
fittest come into force. \n\nA company without a target destination or clear sense of
direction will soon lose momentum, find itself in a cash flow crisis that quickly
advances from survivable to terminal.</string>
    <string name="string_lcztoaiv102">Once you\'ve decided to target a destination, which one do you choose\? There are
only five to choose from so your options are somewhat limited. You\'re not likely to
target Bankruptcy or Shutdown as destinations for your startup so we can cross them
off the list. The only other destinations to target are IPO, Cash Flow Sale and Asset
Sale. Independent survivals of no interest to the investors, so there are only three
        possible routes you could realistically select for your company- <i>Zero-to-Asset Sale</i>,
<i>Zero-to-Cash</i> From <i>Sale</i> and <i>Zero-to-IPO</i>.</string>
    <string name="string_lcztoaiv103">A candidate for Cash Flow Sale is also a candidate for IPO and vice versa. Companies
heading for each of these destinations follow very similar routes, so we can merge
these two routes into one, at least for the first part of the journey.
So, by a process of elimination, we\'re left with only two alternative travel plans for
you to select for your startup-the long haul from Zero-to-IPO and the short sprint
from Zero-to-Asset Sale.</string>

    <string name="SA_stringTB1"><b>Social media marketing</b> is the use of social media platforms and websites to promote a product or service.  Although the terms <i>e-marketing</i> and <i>digital marketing</i> are still dominantin academia, social media marketing is becoming more popular for both practitioners and researchers.\nMost social media platforms have built-in data <i>analytics</i> tools, enabling companies to track the progress,
    success, and engagement of ad campaigns. \nCompanies address a range of stakeholders through social media
    marketing, including current and potential customers, current and potential employees, <i>journalists</i>,
<i>bloggers</i> , and the general public. \nOn a strategic level, social media marketing includes the management
    of a marketing campaign, <i>governance</i>, setting the scope (e.g. more active or passive use) and the
    establishment of a firm\’s desired social media \”culture\” and \”tone.\”\n\n

    When using social media marketing, firms can allow customers and Internet users to post <i> user-generated content </i>
    (e.g., online comments, product reviews, etc.), also known as \”<i>earned media</i>,\” rather than use
    marketer-prepared <i>advertising</i> copy.

    \n
    \n
<b>Strategies</b>\n\n
    There are two basic strategies for using social media as a marketing tool:\n
<i><u>Passive approach</u></i>\n
    Social media can be a useful source of market information and a way to hear customer perspectives.
    Blogs, content communities, and forums are platforms where individuals share their reviews
    and recommendations of brands, products, and services. Businesses are able to tap and analyze
    the customer voices and feedback generated in social media for marketing purposes;[15] in this
    sense the social media is a relatively inexpensive source of market intelligence which can be used
    by marketers and managers to track and respond to consumer-identified problems and detect market
    opportunities. For example, the Internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 \”bend test\”
    which showed that the coveted phone could be bent by hand pressure.\nThe so-called \”bend gate\”
    controversy[16] created confusion amongst customers who had waited months for the launch of the
    latest rendition of the iPhone. However, Apple promptly issued a statement saying that the problem
    was extremely rare and that the company had taken several steps to make the mobile device\’s case
    stronger and robust. Unlike traditional market research methods such as surveys, focus groups, and
    data mining which are time-consuming and costly, and which take weeks or even months to analyze,
    marketers can use social media to obtain \’live\’ or \”real time\” information about consumer behavior
    and viewpoints on a company\’s brand or products. This can be useful in the highly dynamic, competitive,
    fast-paced and global marketplace of the 2010s.\n\n

<i><u>Active approach</u></i>
    Social media can be used not only as public relations and direct marketing tools, but also as
    communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social
    media personalities as effective customer engagement tools.[15] This tactic is widely known as
    influencer marketing. Influencer marketing allows brands the opportunity to reach their target
    audience in a more genuine, authentic way via a special group of selected influencers advertising
    their product or service. In fact, brands are set to spend up to $15 billion on influencer marketing
    by 2022, per Business Insider Intelligence estimates, based on Mediakix data.\n\n

    Technologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers
    with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in the
    sports section of a newspaper is likely to be read by sports fans. However, social media websites
    can target niche markets even more precisely. Using digital tools such as Google AdSense, advertisers
    can target their ads to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in social
    entrepreneurship, political activism associated with a particular political party, or video gaming.
    Google AdSense does this by looking for keywords in social media user\’s online posts and comments.
    It would be hard for a TV station or paper-based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted
    (though not impossible, as can be seen with \”special issue\” sections on niche issues, which
    newspapers can use to sell targeted ads).\n\n

    Social networks are, in many cases, viewed as a great tool for avoiding costly market
    research. They are known for providing a short, fast, and direct way to reach an audience
    through a person who is widely known. For example, an athlete who gets endorsed by a sporting
    goods company also brings their support base of millions of people who are interested in what
    they do or how they play and now they want to be a part of this athlete through their endorsements
    with that particular company. At one point consumers would visit stores to view their products with
    famous athletes, but now you can view a famous athlete\’s, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, latest apparel
    online with the click of a button. He advertises them to you directly through his Twitter, Instagram,
    and Facebook accounts.\n\n

    Facebook and LinkedIn are leading social media platforms where users can hyper-target their ads.
    Hypertargeting not only uses public profile information but also information users submit but hide
    from others.[18] There are several examples of firms initiating some form of online dialog with the
    public to foster relations with customers. According to Constantinides, Lorenzo and Gómez Borja (2008)
    \”Business executives like Jonathan Swartz, President and CEO of Sun Microsystems, Steve Jobs CEO of
    Apple Computers, and McDonald\’s Vice President Bob Langert post regularly in their CEO blogs,
    encouraging customers to interact and freely express their feelings, ideas, suggestions, or remarks
    about their postings, the company or its products\”.[15] Using customer influencers (for example
    popular bloggers) can be a very efficient and cost-effective method to launch new products or
    services. Among the political leaders in office, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the
    highest number of followers at 40 million, and President Donald Trump ranks second with
    25 million followers. Modi employed social media platforms to circumvent traditional

    <string name="SA_stringTB2"><b>IS SEO WORTH IT IN 2021\?</b>\n\n
    Business owners and managers are often skeptical of search engine optimization (SEO) when considering their marketing budget.\n
    \”Is SEO even worth it\?\” They\’ll ask themselves and their staff. And we understand why.
    Unlike with paid ads, there\’s no easy, platform-specific performance dashboard that compares daily
    spend with sales revenue from conversions.\n
    The industry is full of jargon, and it can feel like some service providers are positioning themselves as gurus more than serious businesses.\n
    Some cynics simply conclude that SEO won\’t work for them.
    But the cold, hard data shows a different story. Let\’s see what the numbers say about whether SEO is worth it in 2021.
    \n\n

<b><i>HOW EXPENSIVE IS SEO\?</i></b>\n\n
    While an often-cited study (9-years old) puts the average monthly SEO spend at $5,000 per month, with more freelancers and agencies in the industry than ever, prices have changed.\n

    A recent study by SEO tool provider Ahrefs explored what the current pricing landscape looks like — 74.71% of SEO agencies and freelance consultants offer a monthly retainer.

    Surprisingly, the majority of monthly plans are cheaper than they were just nine short years ago.


    \n
    \nYou can also see that prices vary from SEO company to company to a degree where averages aren\’t very informative.
\n
    The influx in lower monthly fees likely reflects that more small businesses invest in a basic SEO service than ever before.
\n
    But when 56% of the SEOs charge more than $76 per hour, it\’s hard to imagine that you get a lot of work for a retainer of a few hundred dollars.
\n
    Business size, goals, and target market are huge pricing factors
    Of course, you get what you pay for. So, a multinational company with hundreds of different products or services, a $100 monthly retainer — what\’s even in that\? Web hosting\? — probably won\’t cut it.
\n
    Enterprise SEO is a different ballgame than small business SEO. You\’re competing with million-dollar budgets and have to work hard for every tiny improvement.
\n
    We understand that the average small business marketing budget doesn\’t include $10,000 for SEO. But coming up with and implementing a good SEO strategy takes time and expertise.\n

    If you think your company will get world-class search engine optimization for less than your monthly Starbucks budget, you\’ve got another thing coming.\n

    If you think about SEO as an expense, a cost center, it\’s easy to choose the cheapest option. But really, it\’s one of the biggest investment opportunities for your business.
\n
    Think about it like real estate. When opening a new store or restaurant, you\’d aim for areas with a lot of foot traffic.
\n
    SEO is the same, except the people in the \”street\” are potential customers who are actively searching for your products and services. Getting your business in front of these people 24/7, 365 days a year can be life-changing.
\n
    If you\’re not willing to pay, or you can\’t find the money, you\’ll have to invest a lot of your own valuable time on trial and error.
    \n\n<b>HOW EFFECTIVE IS SEO\? DOES IT EVEN GENERATE SALES\?</b>\n
    The short answer is SEO is very effective — not just to generate traffic but also leads and sales. Don\’t worry. The long answer includes research and data, not just empty statements.
\n
    Most SEOs get too caught up in search-specific metrics like SERPs (search engine results page), rankings, and organic traffic.
\n
    For example, organic search gets over 20 times more clicks than any paid Google ad. (Zero-click searches are, for example, resolved by showing the information in a Wikipedia infobox or a word definition.)
    \nThat sounds like a great selling point, right\? Essentially, the traffic potential is 20 times larger with SEO. And you don\’t have to pay for each click for the rest of your life.
\n
    But as a business owner, you care more about your bottom line than flashy metrics. If all that traffic comes from \”how you can unclog your own toilet\” rather than \”plumber in San Diego,\” you won\’t get many sales.
\n
    Search intent and keyword relevance matter.
\n
    But don\’t worry. When done right, SEO attracts potential consumers at beneficial stages in the buying cycle. A true SEO expert knows how to plan an SEO campaign that delivers traffic, conversions, and sales.
\n
    And the proof is in the pudding. For B2B companies, SEO generates more revenue than all other digital marketing channels combined. Across all industries, it averages 44% of all revenue.
\n
    There\’s something powerful about showing up naturally in the top results for Google. Compared to an ad, it almost feels like you\’re getting Google\’s cosign, singling you out as the best result.
\n
    Most experienced digital marketers agree — 70% say that SEO is better for driving sales than PPC.
    \n\n<b>SEO, CONTENT CREATION, WEB DESIGN: HOW CAN I MANAGE IT ALL\?</b>\n\n
    Organic search can seem like a complicated process compared to just cold-calling a list of potential customers.
\n
    SEO alone has hundreds of ranking factors and lots of conflicting information on best practices.
    \n\nCan you make sense of this periodic table of ranking factors\? No\? And these aren\’t even half of the factors that top SEO experts work with.
\n
    On top of that, you need to consider:
\n\n
    -Web design\n
    -Site loading speed and usability\n
    -Overall strategy\n
    -High-quality content\n
    -Landing page sales copy\n\n
    If you don\’t have the experience, that\’s a lot to shovel onto your plate. But if you do decide to outsource, don\’t worry. You don\’t need to pay the hefty price tag to fix absolutely everything at once.

    <string name="SA_stringTB4"><b>The complete guide on how to start freelance writing</b>\n\n
    If you\’ve got a way with words and love to write, maybe you\’re considering looking for freelance writing work. Freelance writers are able to take on a range of projects, from a variety of different employers, which can make for an interesting side hustle, or even a varied and flexible career.
    \n
    Many aspiring writers choose to focus on a specific niche based on their interest and expertise, taking on projects across one or more types of writing. That could leave you doing anything from writing website copy for local businesses, blogging about your hobbies, working with social media channels, or writing for online or print magazines.
    \n
    Freelance writing is a popular choice, with many people taking on occasional freelance projects as an additional income, or moving to a full time freelance writing career to enjoy the benefits of working remotely and to their own schedule. If you\’re keen to make the leap, but not quite sure how to get started, you\’ve come to the right place. Read on for all you need to know about getting started in freelance writing, building a portfolio, and making an income.\n
    \n
    How to start your freelance writing career in 7 easy steps
    For most people getting started in writing, it makes sense to choose a topic to focus on. The good news is that you don\’t necessarily need to have studied the subject you write about, or hold any set qualifications. Often simply being passionate about a topic, and having an engaging writing style, is enough to start winning work.
\n\n
    Here are some simple steps to take to get you on your way:\n\n
    1. <i><u>Choose your niche</u></i>\n\n
    Picking what you want to write about is an important first step. By choosing a niche you\’re enthusiastic about, you\’ll find you can write well without needing to spend hours on research — and your energy will shine through in your work. You could choose one of these popular niches, or pick a favourite hobby or interest of your own:
    \n\n
    -Travel\n
    -Fitness and diet\n
    -Health and wellbeing\n
    -Family, relationships and parenting\n
    -Yoga and meditation\n
    -Cooking and nutrition\n
    -Finance and budgeting\n
    -Leadership and careers\n
    -Crafting, knitting or other creative hobbies\n\n

    2. <u><i>Set up a website or blog</i></u>\n\n
    Having an online presence is essential if you want to become a freelance writer. Writing your own blog is a simple way to achieve this, and gives a space to write, share, and get feedback on your work. You can get a blog for free from Wordpress or Wix, or post on an outlet like Medium. Alternatively you may want to set up your own website to serve both as a space for blogging and an online resume and portfolio to share with prospective customers.\n\n



    3. <i><u>Write great sample work</u></i>\n\n
    Before you can progress any further you\’ll need to create sample work which becomes your portfolio. Many writers publish online on their own blogs, or as guest writers for other blogs and online magazines. Share your work with family and friends at this stage, to start to get feedback and develop a reader base.
    \n
    When you start to send out pitches for paid work, you can use your sample work as a resume to show what you\’re capable of.
    \n\n

    4. <u><i>Pitch yourself everywhere</i></u>\n\n
    You\’ve now put together your portfolio and started to build your readership in your chosen subject. It\’s time to start to pitch for more work. You\’ll find that online and print magazines and other outlets may offer one off paid projects, guest opportunities, or ongoing writing jobs. Some of these may not be paid - or may pay only a token amount. However, for many new freelance writers, they\’re a neat way to build your portfolio further and reach a broader audience — so well worth considering.\n\n

    You can also pitch companies and websites you love, to offer your services. Here are a few great ways to get your name out there:
    \n
    \n- Develop a short, effective \’elevator pitch\’ so you\’re always ready to tell someone what you do. You never know who you\’ll run into who may need a writer
    \n- Contact companies you love and offer to either write for their blog or create sponsored posts about their products for your own blog
    \n- Join networking groups online and in person to build connections among other freelance writers. It\’s common for available jobs to be shared in these communities
    \n- Pitch online and print magazines directly, contacting the editors with ideas for specific articles you may provide
    \n- Look at freelance marketplace sites like Fiverr, Upwork and Freelancer.com — there are often writing opportunities here, although they may not be the highest paid out there. Pick the jobs that appeal and use it as a springboard to bigger things if you need to
    \n- If you love to blog, read and comment on other blogs in your niche. You\’ll quickly get to know other writers, and may find opportunities to collaborate and share ideas
    \n- Keep your LinkedIn and other social media pages up to date and include links to your published work for employers to see

    \n5. <u><i>Check writing job boards</i></u>\n\n
    - Specialist job boards are a perfect source of leads if you\’re looking for more high profile and paid writing work.** Communities of writers may share ideas and information about sites, magazines and blogs you can connect with.** Take a look at these job boards and resources as a great starting point:
    \n- IWriter
    \n- BloggingPro
    \n- The Writer Finder\n\n
    6. <i><u>Collect testimonials from your clients</u></i>\n\n
    As you start to build a reputation, it can really help to have testimonials from previous clients. Ask for a few words about working with you, either by email after you\’ve completed a job, or using the testimonial function on LinkedIn. Publish great client reviews on your website so new customers can see what you do best.
    \n


<b> Three tips for making more money as a freelance writer</b> \n\n
    Like any new business, it\’ll take time to grow your freelance writing career and develop the connections you need to start earning money. However, once you\’re up and running it can be a great second income — or a full time job if you\’d like it to be.
    \n
<i>Here are some tips on taking your freelance writing to the next level, and earning more money as you go:</i>\n
    \n
    The right goals for you will depend on whether you\’re writing for fun, as a second stream of income to supplement your full time job, or as a future career. However, having some goals set out in writing is the best way to make sure you stay on the track that works for you. Your goals might be to write a certain number of pieces per week, to get published in a particular magazine, or to earn a fixed monthly amount, for example.
    \n\n
    Working freelance means you\’re in charge of your own time. This is an amazing perk — but also can mean that you spend longer than you realize on some pieces of work, or that you blur the lines between work time and leisure time. Tracking how you spend your time is the best way to make sure you\’re charging the right amount for your work, and can help you see ways to earn more by focusing on the writing which pays best per hour.

<b>How to be a truly great freelance writer\?</b>\n\n
    Once you have your basic building blocks in place, it\’s time to take your writing from good to great. Here\’s how:\n
\n
    1. Research everything thoroughly\n
    2. Get familiar with the skills and tools that are required\n
    3. Become a master of organization\n

        \n\n\n
\tYou\’ve probably seen a lot of ebooks on offer recently, and it\’s no surprise: they\’re one of the best marketing tools available to entrepreneurs, not to mention an amazing way to instantly boost your business\’ credibility and visibility. In this post, we\’ll run you through how to create an ebook that will stand out, from coming up with your idea to perfecting your final product.\n
    \n
    <b>Why write an ebook\?</b>\n
\tIf you\’re an entrepreneur who wants to build your brand, writing an ebook is an effective tool to do just that. While writing an ebook can be a significant investment of time and resources, it will reliably pay dividends to those who do it right. Here\’s what you stand to gain as the author of a quality ebook:\n
    \n
<b>Credibility as an expert:</b>\n \tHaving a book can provide you with concrete evidence of your professional know-how and set you up as an authority in your field.\n
<b>Added value to your content:</b>\n\t By expanding on the content you already have online and collating it in one convenient place, you\’re making it more likely that your audience will seek it out.
<b>New audience:</b>\n\tIf you market your ebook effectively, people within your target audience will stumble across your content without even knowing it\’s yours, opening you up to a whole new market.
\nAn irresistible \”lead magnet\”: Even if you give your ebook away for free, you\’ll be able to collect email addresses from people interested in your area and build up your mailing list — a valuable resource for your marketing campaigns.
\nAnother revenue stream (maybe): If your ebook is so popular that you decide to monetize it down the line, you get to keep whatever money you make on sales. Cha-ching!
\nCreating an ebook versus a print book
\nWhile you may dream of holding a physical copy of your book in your hands, there are several benefits to ebooks, either instead of or as well as physical copies.
    \n\n
<i>It\’s quick and easy:</i>\tCreating an ebook is a pain-free process, provided you do your research ahead of time and bring in professional help where you need it.\n
<i>It\’s cheap:</i>\tDepending on how much you do yourself, creating an ebook can be dirt cheap (or even free) compared to the higher costs of creating a print book.\n
<i>It\’s instantly available to your reader:</i>\n\tWhile physical books need a certain amount of time to print and distribute copies, ebooks can land on your reader\’s digital device within seconds.
\nYou can offer it for free: Because an ebook has a per-unit cost of almost nothing, you can comfortably offer it for free. For most authors, giving away free print books is not financially sustainable — after all, paper doesn\’t grow on trees. 😉
\nYou can link out to other content: Having your book in digital form means you can link out to blog posts and helpful resources easily, keeping your readers on your site and adding to the ease of use for certain types of books.
\nYou can make updates easily: If you want to add to or update your ebook, turnaround times will be much shorter than if you had to send corrections to a physical printer. This means you can keep your book up to date with cutting-edge information if you want to!
\nNo printing = more images: Printing glossy, high-quality images are not cheap, but a digital-only format means you can pack in more helpful (and attractive) images, graphs, and graphics to break up the text of your book and make it user friendly.
\nHow can I create an ebook if I\’m not a writer\?\n
\nWriting is a skill we can all develop, but you might not have the time on your hands right now to perfect the craft. Seeing as you probably already outsource other tasks in your business, you may want to outsource the writing of your ebook, too.
    \n
\tGhostwriters are professional writers who specialize in writing for other people. Some ghostwriting happens collaboratively, while other times, the ghost will go away and write to a brief you\’ve provided them with. A ghost can provide a safe pair of hands to ensure the final product is a genuinely valuable, high-quality piece of writing that reflects well on your business.
    \n
<b>How to write an ebook in 7 simple steps</b>\n
    Now that we know why we\’re writing, let\’s get into the steps you need to go from a completely blank page to your fully-formed ebook, ready to publish.
    \n        \n\n
    1. <b>Research your target market</b>\n
    If you\’re creating an ebook as a way to market your business, that target audience should be the same as your product or service. If you\’re creating an ebook as a self-contained product, you\’ll want to do more research into your ideal readers.
    \n
    Your user base won\’t be a monolith, but it can help to generalize for a hot second with factors like age, types of occupation, or level of disposable income. These insights can help make choices about the topic you write about or the solutions you suggest, so it\’s important to conduct some research into them. Let\’s take a hypothetical example:\n
    These insights will come in very handy through pretty much every step of the process. So don\’t skimp on the consumer research.

    Once you\’ve gathered your data, you need to burrow into that reader\’s mind and choose your topic wisely — more on that next!\n
    \n
    2. <b>Choose your topic</b>\n
    In the course of your market research, you\’ll hopefully have considered who your reader is and what they might want from an ebook. This will be key in determining its topic. If you have no idea where to start, a good tactic is to get inside your reader\’s head and ask yourself the following questions:
    \n
    What would be useful for your target reader\?\n
    Is there a question your audience repeatedly asks\? Can you provide an answer\?\n
    Is there a resource your target reader is looking for\?\n
    Is there a topic that you have posted about before that you feel could be expanded upon in longer form content\? (If you\’re a blogger who already has a lot of material to work with, you can check out our tips on how to convert your blog into a book).
    \n\n
    While you may be tempted to use your ebook exclusively to advertise your own product or service,  people are unlikely to read pure promotional material (and even less likely to recommend it to friends). Instead, identify a need among your target audience, and take it from there.

    \n\n
    3. <b>Scope out the competition</b>\n
    It\’s not enough to identify a killer question to answer in your ebook: you\’ve got to answer it better than anyone else. That usually means more research.\n

    Read around your subject and see what\’s already been written. If you find that there\’s actually already a lot of information on your chosen topic, the market is oversaturated, and you may need to go back to the drawing board. \n\n
    What makes your ebook unique\?\n
    Identify a gap in the market — something that doesn\’t already exist. While the temptation is usually to cover big, popular topics, you will find many other people have the same idea. The more well-covered a topic is, the more competition your ebook will face, no matter how great it is.\n
    \n
    But if your topic of choice has been covered before, don\’t despair! It\’s still possible to draw readers in with a unique angle, especially if what has already been published is written by an obscure author who hasn\’t made the most of marketing their ebook. The most important thing is to check out what has already been written and think carefully about your prospects of beating out that competition.

    \n\n

    4. <b>Plan your structure with your solution in mind</b>\n
    A chapter-by-chapter outline will ensure you hit all the relevant points as you write your first draft. It will also save time in the editing process by keeping your writing tight and to the point.
\n
    So before you set pen to paper (or finger to keyboard), break down your overall aim in writing the book, your chapter headings, and the key points you want to make within each section. To give you a jumping-off point, here are a few structures to consider, depending on what fits your content best:
\n
<i>The \”how-to\”</i> structure
\tIf you\’re writing a straightforward how-to guide, you\’ll want to keep your structure linear. Dedicating a chapter to each step, and breaking those down into subsections if necessary, will make it easy to navigate and help your reader follow the sequence.
\n
<i>The \”leveling up\”</i> structure
\tIf you\’re not providing an exhaustive how-to but are instead providing additional tips to help people level up their skills, you\’ve got a lot of flexibility in terms of structure. You can dedicate a chapter to each tip, starting with the most basic tips to the most complex or you can order it based on the benefits each improvement will bring to your reader —  the sky\’s the limit!

<i>The \”wait, but why\?\”</i> structure
    If you\’re providing a unique solution to a problem, your readers may not understand why a new approach is necessary. Take some time at the beginning of the book to explain the problem with the status quo and what your proposed solution does better. You\’ll want to relate back to this now and again during the following chapters, even if they follow a straightforward \”how-to\” structure from then on.\n\n

    5. <b>Choose your writing platform</b>\n
\tYou can definitely draft your ebook text with a normal word processor, such as Microsoft Word. However, it\’s worth considering using specialized book formatting software for your writing. This will save you time in the long run by ensuring that your text is already formatted optimally for an ebook before you even finish writing.\n
\tIf you choose to write in a general use word processor, just know that you will have to go back and format your content into a proper book layout later. Customers will be reluctant to pay for or read a book that doesn\’t look like the real deal. To convert your writing into a professional-looking ebook, you\’ll want to consider chapter headings, line spacing, fonts, and other aspects of how the text looks on the page. Sounds complicated, but luckily we have our exhaustive guide to formatting a book to help you out!\n\n
    6.<b>Flesh out your plan with effective content</b>\n
\tNow\’s the time to do the actual writing part. If you\’ve got a solid outline, this process shouldn\’t be too rough. Just take it section by section, and remember that you can always come back and polish things up in the edit.
    \n
\tBut those are general tips that apply to any type of writing. When writing an ebook for business, here are a few things you should bear in mind as you write.
    \n
    Include the <b><i>\”why\”</i></b>\n
\t<i>Within the introduction of your ebook, it\’s a good idea not only to address what topics you\’ll be covering but also to address why you\’re writing this ebook in the first place. Underline the key need that you identified in your target research. Make sure people understand what the problem is and that you\’re going to be the one to solve it.</i>\n\n
    7.<b>Edit to a professional level</b>

    \n
    Editing can be a drag, but it is absolutely essential to turn out a polished and professional manuscript. An overly-long and bloated first draft isn\’t going to hold your reader\’s attention. Equally, sloppy writing is going to be a major red flag for your reader. Your ebook is a reflection of you, and by extension, your product or service — so don\’t let silly mistakes ruin your credibility!\n\n

    After writing, it\’s usually best to wait a few days before looking back over your work. Then read through it start to finish, and ask yourself:\n\n

    Have you addressed the question or problem you set out for yourself\?\n
    Have you hit all the points you wanted to\?\n
    Does your writing sound convincing and professional\?\n
    If the answer to any of these questions is \”no,\” you\’ll need to make revisions.\n

    \n It\’s definitely worth doing an initial editing pass yourself to address these problems (self-editing is one of the key steps in any writing process). Still, if you want to turn out a truly professional piece of work, you\’ll want to consider hiring a professional editor. Luckily, various editors can help you out, from developmental editing (the big picture stuff) to proofreading (the granular stuff, like spelling and grammar).\n

    \n\n
    8. <b>Get it out into the world!</b>\n
    Okay, that oversimplifies it a little. But once you\’ve come up with your concept, written, and edited your ebook, you really are on the home stretch!\n\n

\tYour next big task is probably going to be putting together a professional-looking cover. Again, your ebook is a reflection of you, so it\’s important to make sure this cover is something you\’re proud of. The temptation to cobble together your own cover is understandable, but it can be worth investing in a professional designer\’s services. It\’s the first thing your readers will see, and a bad cover will make your book look amateurish and undermine the hard work you put into writing.\n\n</string>

\n
\n
    01. <b>Brainstorm blog topics</b>\n\n


\tWhen writing a blog post, whether it\’s you\’re guest posting for someone else or writing for your own blog, you\’ll want to cover topics that bring value to your readers and fall in line with their interests, as well as your own. Rather than trying to find the perfect topic right away, start by jotting down different ideas that come to mind.
\n\n


    There are several places you can look to spark new topic ideas:
\n
    Browse other blogs within your niche. If you\’re writing a travel blog, for example, simply Google \”travel blog\” to see what your competitors are writing about.
\n
    Use Google Trends to find out which topics are trending.
\n
    Look for current events and recent news stories related to your field.
\n
    Find out what people enjoy learning about by browsing online courses on Udemy, Skillshare and LinkedIn Learning.
\n


\tOnce you find some interesting ideas online, think about the unique ways you can approach those topics. Consider the various ways you can play around with topic ideas to come up with something that isn\’t only trendy and relevant, but that\’s also original and fresh.
\n


\tLet\’s say, for instance, that you want to write about chocolate chip cookies. There are a few different angles you might consider taking here:
\n


\tA how-to post that instructs readers how to do something with clearly ordered steps (e.g., \”How to Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies from Scratch\”)
\n

    A curated list that offers a set of recommendations for your readers (e.g., \”The Top Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipes\”)
\n

    A tips and advice post that provides expert guidance and resources. (e.g., \”Tips for Making Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies Extra Gooey\”)
\n

    A definition-based blog post that helps explain the meaning of a term or topic (e.g., \”What Are No-Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies\”)
\n

    A top trends article that highlights what\’s currently popular (e.g. \”The Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipes From This Year\”)
\n

    A personal or business update that lets you unveil something fresh or recently unknown (e.g.,  \”My New Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe Revealed\”)\n\n
    02. <b>Refine your topic with keyword research</b>\n\n


\tPart of writing a blog post involves keyword research. This crucial SEO practice is used as a marker to see which terms you can potentially rank high for in certain online searches.
\n


\tOnce you\’ve chosen a direction for your blog post, you\’ll need to figure out the chances of its success on search engine result pages - which ultimately means getting more eyes on your content. In order to succeed, conduct keyword research to find the most relevant queries for your topic.
\n\n


\tYou can find keywords for your own articles by using various keyword research tools. If you\’re new to blogging, you\’ll probably want to start with free tools such as Answer the Public, Ubersuggest, and Google Keyword Planner. Afterwards, you may want to upgrade to more advanced tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs.
\n\n


\tWhile conducting keyword research, keep in mind that the more specific the phrase, the more closely it will match your audience\’s intent. On the other hand, broader keywords tend to have higher search volumes - meaning more people are searching for them each month.
\n


\tThink about the benefits of opting for a broader phrase, like \”chocolate chip cookies,\” over a more precise phrase, like \”how to make chocolate chip cookies.\” Choosing the right keywords means striking a balance between high search volume and high intent.
\n


\tOnce you\’ve selected your keywords, you can use them to shape the structure of your content. Google those phrases to find out which articles have successfully targeted those same keywords, and spend some time browsing their content. This will give you inspiration for your own article in terms of what to include and how to structure it.\n\n

    03. <b>Define your audience</b>\n\n

\tNow that you know what you\’ll be writing about, you need to find out who you\’re writing for. Anticipating the kinds of people who will be reading your posts will help you create content that is interesting, engaging and shareable.
\n


\tOf course, your audience largely depends on your type of blog. If you run a baking blog, you\’ll probably be writing for an audience of people who love baking and are seeking recipe inspiration. Even more specifically, if you run a healthy baking blog, you\’ll be writing for people who similarly love baking but who want to make their culinary creations healthier. It\’s important to keep these nuances in mind when crafting your content, since your goal is to write articles that resonate strongly with readers.
\n\n

\tSo, how do you figure out your audience in the first place\? Start by taking another look at the other blogs in your field. Consider who they seem to be writing for, and the kinds of assumptions they\’re making about their readers\’ interests and lifestyles. For example, you might find that most of the blogs address a particular gender or age group.
\n


\tYou can also use online forums to find the main questions asked by your audience, or visit Facebook groups to read what topics they like or talk about. This will help you create content that piques their interest, sparks their curiosity and answers their questions.
\n\n



    04. <b>Create an organized outline</b>\n\n


\tThe key to learning how to write a blog post is doing thorough research and planning before you create the article itself. After deciding on the topic and blog format, you\’ll need to build the mold for your content. Creating an outline is critical, as it ensures your article will have a strong foundation that you can build on as you write your blog post.
\n

\n
\tStart by creating subheaders, which are the backbone of an organized outline. These small but mighty pieces of content help you break down your article into bite-sized sections - making it easier for you to write and more digestible for people to read.
\n

\n
\tIf it\’s a step-by-step guide or a list of tips, start building your outline by listing out all the main points clearly, as in the example below:
\n\n


    Outline: How to Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies from Scratch
\n
    1. Gather your ingredients
\n
    2. Mix and knead the dough
\n
    3. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper
\n
    4. Scoop mounds of dough onto baking sheet
\n
    5. Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit
\n

\tAdd bulleted notes within your introduction and under each of your subheaders. This will help you formulate your main points.
\n


    If you find yourself getting stuck, use one of these blog post templates to guide you through the outline process.
\n\n


    05. <b>Write engaging content</b>\n\n


\tNow that you\’ve sketched out the blog post, you can begin typing away. Keep in mind that blog posts, like many other types of writing, typically include three main elements: an introduction, the body text, and a conclusion.
\n\n


\tLet\’s start with the introduction. In the first few sentences of your article, you should already grab your readers\’ attention. Begin with a relevant quote or statistic, tell a short story, or share an interesting fact. Then, set the tone for the article by sharing a brief summary of what you\’re going to talk about in the body text. This gives your readers a reason to keep going.
\n\n


\tNext, fill in the body text. In your outline, these are the bullet points beneath each subheader. This is the meat of your blog post, so it should be clear and compelling. Avoid fluff and repetition, and instead offer deep value by sharing your knowledge, research, and insights.
\n\n


\tA concluding section isn\’t always necessary - in fact, our blog rarely uses one - but it can be useful in the case of storytelling or when wrapping up a very extensive article. You can tie your main points together using a short bulleted list, or by sharing some closing thoughts in a few sentences. No matter the case, you\’ll want to end on an engaging note.
\n\n
\n

    06. <b>Craft an irresistible headline</b>\n\n


\tWhen writing a blog post, you don\’t only need strong content; you\’ll also want a powerful headline. A great headline entices readers and enhances your blog design, ensuring that they actually click on your article in the first place.
\n\n


\tLearning how to write a catchy blog title doesn\’t have to be hard. All you need to do is keep the following points in mind: clarity, specificity and offering an answer or solution.
\n\n


\tWriting a good headline also depends on how well you put yourself in the shoes of your audience. Use the title to promise readers that your blog post will provide valuable insight that will benefit them in some way, whether by satisfying their intellectual curiosity, teaching them something new, or helping them solve a problem. This will increase the chances that they\’ll click on your article and read it.
\n\n


\tHere are some examples of headlines that we are quite proud of, to give you a general idea for your own content:
\n\n


    \n<i>Create a Powerful Free Landing Page in Under an Hour</i>

  \n<i>20 Best Time Management Apps to Organize Your Life</i>

   \n<i>How to Design an A+ School Website (With Examples)</i>

    \n<i>Make a Change: Using Photography as a Tool to Raise Awareness</i>\n

(Shhh, Search it from Google)
\n\n\n


    07. <b>Stylize your blog post</b>\n\n


    Writing your blog post may be your first priority, but you\’ll also want to package it in an appealing way. Having an article with strong visual appeal is crucial for striking the right chord with your readers.
\n\n


    If you\’re writing a blog about organic ingredients, for instance, using a natural color palette on your site will set the right tone for the type of topics you\’ll be writing about. This same color palette should also be used for your blog logo, as well as on your social media platforms.
\n\n


    The best way to customize your blog\’s design is by choosing from one of these free blog templates. These are all created by professional designers, and they\’re fully customizable to reflect your blog\’s messaging and tone. For inspiration, check out these blog examples to see how others have used these templates to transform their blogs into beautiful, content-rich powerhouses.\n\n\n

    08. <b>Pick relevant images</b>\n\n


\tLikewise, you should also enhance your blog post with a few great images that illustrate your main points. It\’s important that your pictures add value to the subject, rather than serving as placeholders. Pay extra attention to your featured image - this will be the main visual below your blog\’s title, and it\’s what readers will see when they browse your articles from your blog\’s homepage.
\n\n


\tWith Wix, you can add a professional photo gallery to individual posts and embed your own pictures within your articles. You can also choose from an array of media content from Wix, Shutterstock, and Unsplash directly within your site\’s editor.
\n\n\n


    09. <b>Implement calls-to-action</b>\n\n


\tIn the same way a blog is meant to inform people about specific topics, it can also be used as an important tool that motivates readers to take a certain action. This includes everything from subscribing to your blog to making a purchase.



  \n\n\tThis element is referred to as CTA, or call-to-action, and is presented as an embedded link or button that states your objective in an alluring manner. Some of the most common call-to-action examples for blogs include \”Subscribe,\” \”Download our e-book\” or \”Sign up.\”
\n\n


\tUsing CTAs can help you transform your website traffic into engagement and, eventually, profit. While your immediate goal is to get more readers, you may eventually want to monetize your blog further down the road.
\n\n\n


    10. <b>Optimize for SEO</b>\n\n


\tWhen it comes to SEO for bloggers, a strong SEO plan involves optimizing your content both before and after writing the blog post. Not only does this include doing keyword research prior to the outline phase (mentioned in step 3), but it also includes using those keywords to polish your final piece.
\n\n


\tThis begins with sprinkling relevant keywords throughout your article. Let\’s say you\’ve chosen to target the keyword \”business strategies.\” Use this exact phrase in your headline, throughout the body text, and 1-2 subheaders if it\’s a natural fit.
\n\n


\tNext, include this keyword in your metadata. This is the preview text you\’ll see for every article on Google, and it includes a title (known as the meta title) and short description (the meta description). You\’ll also want to add the keywords to the URL of your article, as well as in the alt text of your blog post\’s images. Use these SEO features to give your blog an overall performance boost. Lastly, and make sure you know exactly how long a blog post should be to best rank your post.
\n\n\n



    11. <b>Edit and publish your blog post</b>\n\n


\tWith so many common blogging mistakes out there, you\’ll need to thoroughly check your article for grammatical errors, repetition and any other unprofessional content. Furthermore, make sure your ideas flow coherently throughout each section, signaling a clear and purposeful message to readers. You can read about other essential aspects of blogging in this comprehensive blog post checklist.
\n\n


\tWe recommend asking a friend or colleague to give your blog article a once over before it goes live. Direct them to look for any discrepancies or ambiguity. It\’s also important to emphasize quality over quantity in order to keep your readers interested. Then, once you\’re happy with your written work, it\’s time to hit publish.
\n\n\n

    12. <b>Promote the final article</b>\n\n


\tOnce you\’ve written and published the blog post, take the necessary steps to make sure it gets read. Two of the most effective ways to promote your blog post and get readers are email marketing and social media marketing.
\n\n


\tEmail remains one of the most reliable platforms for marketing, as it allows for a direct communication channel between you and your audience. This highly effective digital marketing strategy involves sending out customized emails to prospective users with the aim of converting them into loyal fans. If you\’re interested in getting started, this powerful email marketing service can help you send custom newsletters for your blog.
\n\n


\tBeyond emails, sharing your article on social media can also go a long way. For example, if you want to accrue a wide audience, promote your blog on Facebook or Instagram, which have one of the largest and most diverse user bases.
\n


\tWhichever channels you choose, make sure to actively engage with followers on a day-to-day basis. This will ensure that you not only write a great blog post, but that you get people reading your article, too.

    <string name="SA_stringTB7"><b>6 Steps to Becoming a Freelance Web Developer</b>\n\n\n
\tHere we\’ll go through a useful process to follow for you to get up and running. If you\’d prefer to skip ahead to one particular step, simply use the clickable menu:\n\n

    <b>Find your niche</b>
    <b>Start building—anything and everything</b>
    <b>Create your personal brand</b>
    <b>Get organised</b>
    <b>Build up your experience, project by project</b>
    <b>Be brave</b>\n\n\n


    1. <b>Find your niche</b>\n\n
    Want to stand out from the crowd\?\n

    Firstly you\’ll need to find a web development course and upgrade your skills. Then, find yourself a niche and focus your skills.\n

    While it\’s great to be a programmer that can do a bit of everything, your value will be higher as an expert in just a few areas.\n

    \”Becoming known as the solution to a particular set of problems is crucial to your freelance career, so you need to be willing to differentiate and then lock it in.\” – Ted Johnson, <i>freelance web developer</i>\n

    You don\’t ever just want to be \”that developer I know\” but rather \”an expert developer for [insert problem here]\”.
\n
\tIt\’ll be much easier to advertise your skills and make a name for yourself if you can say you\’re the best in a particular, sought-after area, or the only one who can do it.
\n
\tIt\’s important to hone your skills and stay on top of current trends. Not sure what\’s hot on the market right now\? Here are the three most up-and-coming programming languages you\’ll find today:
\n\n
<u>Ruby on Rails</u>\n
\tAs explained in our full Ruby on Rails guide, this open source web application framework runs via the Ruby programming language.\n\n

    <u>Swift</u>\n
    \tSwift is Apple\’s innovative programming language for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.\n

\tStructured for iOS development, Swift has a number of benefits, including syntax that\’s concise yet expressive, and apps run lightning-fast.\n\n

    <u>Node.js</u>\n
\tThis is a platform built on Chrome\’s JavaScript runtime to build fast, scalable network applications easily. Essentially, it allows you to use JavaScript on the backend. If you\’d like to learn more about it, we\’ve created a complete beginner\’s guide to Node.js.\n\n\n

    2. <b>Start building anything and everything</b>\n\n
    You\’ve found your niche. Congratulations! Now it\’s time to get building.\n

    The best place to start is your portfolio website, the one website you will update, edit and continually develop for your entire career.\n

    Your portfolio is a way of displaying your skills and having an easy reference for potential clients.\n

    If in doubt, remember: your goal is to be easy to find, easy to remember, and good to know.\n

    So, once you\’ve published your CV, previewed samples of your past work and added a contact form—what should you do now\?
\n
\tBuild your ideas, they are what make you, you! Once you\’ve built your portfolio, next you\’ll need things to put in it. \nThis is an opportunity to boost your personal brand by:\n\n

    <b><i>Practising your niche skill</i></b>\n
    <b><i>Building your own ideas</i></b>\n
<b><i>Exhibiting your technical chops</i></b>\n
<b><i>Your portfolio is your shop window</i></b>,\n so make sure that it, and its contents, represent your very best work. And if you want help making it better, help others!\n\n

    Keep a blog that explains your process, ask and answer questions on social media, and build, build, build every day.
    \n\n\n
    3. <b>Create your personal brand</b>\n\n
    It\’s all about the hustle! Getting your name out there as an expert in the field can be tough, but if you want the freelance lifestyle, you\’ll have to hustle for it.
    \n
    The good news is that there are so many opportunities for professionals to get known without spending a penny.
    \n
    By showcasing your work, building a network, teaching and blogging like an expert, you will find more than enough ways to connect with people and for people to find you.
    \n
    It\’s crucial that you talk to people. Online and off.
    \n
    Always keep in mind that you\’ll have to talk to a lot of people to find and land clients, so get used to it!
    \n
    Professional freelancer Rebecca Shapiro has this advice:
    \n
    \t\”Make sure that you seek freelancers outside of your industry, as well. Be as far-reaching as possible. Go into building these relationships with an attitude of giving instead of getting and you\’ll find you\’ve easily built a reciprocal referral network.\”\n

    \tMake yourself visible by keeping your goals simple. Getting Google to find you if you have a normal name can be tough.
    \n
    \tFocus on attaching your name across your portfolio, social profiles and content to the terminology of your niche skill.
    \n
    \tAs usual, the internet is an extremely valuable resource. There are some great websites for online marketing that you\’ll already be familiar with, but they can be great for different reasons:
    \n
    \t<u>Twitter</u> — Create a following by tweeting about current news in your niche. Great for networking and having conversations with people in your field from around the world.\n
    \t<u>Quora</u> — Great for answering questions from people interested in your niche. Fosters relationships with other professionals, while getting your name out there in Web Development circles.
    \n
    \t<u>YouTube</u> — Create online tutorials and upload them. Give them easy-to-Google titles like: \”How to become a Freelance Web Developer….\” make them personal and funny; the more watchable they are, the more people will come back to you.\n\n
    Last but not least:\n\n

    Teaching is a great opportunity for web developers to build a brand.\n
    \n
    There are thousands of opportunities across the web for building, writing and mentoring in your particular niche, including our own industry-leading learning platform.\n\n
    4. <b>Get organised</b>\n\n
    Becoming a freelance web developer is not just about knowing how to code.\n

    It\’s about being a project manager, a salesperson and Head of Customer Care—all at the same time.
    \n
    You might not have had much experience in these areas but they are just as crucial to the success of your freelancing career.\n

    This means you need to get organised!\n

    (And we all need help with that)\n

    Use these time and project management tools to make life easier:\n\n

<b> Quoteroller</b> is a practical, time-saving way to create and send professional proposals to clients in a matter of minutes. You can chart your proposal\’s performance and even see when the client has opened it.\n\n
<b>Toggl</b> and <b>Timely</b> are great ways to track projects and see how much time you are spending on each one.\n\n
<b>Asana</b> is an excellent project management system, especially if you are working with others and need to delegate tasks or collaborate.\n\n
<b>Google</b> has an infinite range of calendars and management apps.\n
<b>BillingsPro</b> for project management and invoicing.\n
<b>FreshBooks</b> organise your projects, invoicing and expenses all with one app.\n
<b>HubStaff</b> is an <i>Asana</i> integration that will help you to track your time and productivity, and bill clients accordingly.\n\n
<u>Finally:</u> <i>Do your research, ask friends, colleagues, and other freelancers what they use.</i>
    \n\n
<i>Josh Boyd</i>, freelancer and writer for Crunch, has this advice:\n

    \t\”The most useful thing I realised about freelancing was not to despair when things went a bit wrong. New tax forms to fill out and late-paying clients would make me reconsider, but it\’s worth remembering freelancing is meant to be a challenge. If it were easy, it wouldn\’t be half as rewarding.\”\n\n

    5. <b>Build up your experience, project by project</b>\n\n
    \tNow that you\’ve got that new, in-demand skill under your belt and a slick website, it\’s time to do some real projects to show potential clients.\n
    \n
    \t<b>Upwork</b>, <b>Glassdoor</b> and <b>Freelancer.com</b> are great online marketplaces for newbies in the field to start taking on jobs and gaining experience.\n\n

    \tDo this while you\’re still in your full-time job to get a feel of the amount of time you\’ll need and what you can realistically start to earn per project.\n\n

    \tWhile you\’re still finding your feet, experience is what counts. You are still very much in the learning process here: Learning how to be a business person and a freelancer.\n\n

    Use this step as a chance to learn how to handle clients, to find out what they will expect from you.
    \n
    Find your feet by helping someone out!
    \n
    \tDoing projects for local charities, schools or small businesses who simply can\’t afford to pay a web developer\’s rate helps you and them.\n

    As Joshua Kemp writes in his blog, Confessions Of An Unlikely Developer:
    \n
    \t\”Find a friend with a TINY small business (any business), or you can just find a crappy old site that needs a serious facelift.\”\n

    \tBy doing this, you are building up your portfolio and getting great references for your CV: crucially, you\’ll learn how to deal with people.\n\n

    6. <b>Be brave</b>\n\n
    This is my final and most important piece of advice:\n

    When you start out, you\’re not going to be an expert in your field.\n

    \tYou may take on projects that you aren\’t sure how you\’re going to finish. If that\’s the case, if you\’re not 100% confident of how you\’re going to complete a project—give your client a realistic idea of when they can expect that work back. If you tell them it\’s going to take longer than they expect, it\’s better you tell them that now than when the deadline has passed.\n\n

    Help is out there!\n

    \tOur reliable friend <i>Google</i> can help you with almost every kind of programming query you have, as well as websites like <b><i>StackOverflow</i></b>.
    \n\n
    \tDon\’t let lack of confidence stop you from taking on these bigger projects. It\’s how you\’ll develop as a freelancer and how you\’ll learn your trade.
    \n\n
    \tAnything is possible. You\’re your own boss now.
    \n
    \tFreelance Web Development: Wrap-Up\n
    In case you haven\’t picked up on this by now, let me be clear—being a freelance web developer isn\’t easy. In fact, it\’s damned hard work. But the rewards of the freelance lifestyle will exponentially outweigh all of this.
    \n\n
    \tYou need to build your reputation as a hard worker, and as a reliable, honest web developer.
    \n\n
    \t<i>Always keep these 3 guiding principles in mind:</i>\n\n

<b><u>Don\’t take shortcuts.</u></b>\n
<b><u>Don\’t rush a project. </u></b>\n
<b><u>Don\’t treat any client better or worse than the next one. </u></b>\\n
<b><u>Get as much experience as you can and always, always do a good job. </u></b>\n
    \n\n

\tUniversities worldwide provide Bachelor degrees in Computer Science specialized in a wide range of areas. Here are only a few examples:\n\n

    <b>Data Science</b>
    <b>Games and Multimedia</b>
    <b>IT Security</b>\n\n
\tThis can lead to confusions, especially to students who prepare to become tech experts. Such is the case of App development vs. Software programming. Are these disciplines the same thing and if not, how are they different\?\n\n

\tThe easy answer is: App developers create mobile and computer apps and software programmers create, test programs or systems and fix bugs if and when they encounter them. But there\’s more to it.\n\n

   <b><u> App Development and Software Programming explained</u></b>\n
\tAnyone who hears \’App development\’ instantly thinks of mobile applications. And they are not wrong. App development means the process of designing, creating, testing and finally launching an app that is meant to satisfy the need of many users.\n\n

\tHowever, App development does not refer strictly to smartphone mobile applications. It can also include developing new type of applications for computers or other electronic devices (such as car navigation systems). This can be the first kind of confusion: isn\’t designing an app for computers called web development\? Well, yes and no.\n\n

\tWeb development covers a multiple set of tasks, functions, operations and design, whereas an application (for computers or mobile phones) usually involves one or a few functions and is created after an extensive research that led to the idea.\n\n

\tSoftware programming, sometimes called software engineering deals with writing code to create a software program. A software programmer needs to know coding and excel at developing algorithms, always run tests to make sure all the codes are correct and fix bugs. Along the way, software programmers may decide to make some changes to the software and adds documentation within the code itself.\n\n\n

    <b><i>How is App Development different and similar to Software Programming\?</i></b>\n\n
    What do app developers and software programmers have in common\? They should both possess the following set of skills:\n\n\n

    - <b>high-level of programming and technical skills</b>\n
    - <b>creativity and quick problem-solving skills</b>\n
    - <b>analytical and logical thinking</b>\n
    - <b>numerical and math skills</b>\n
    - <b>ability to work under pressure</b>\n
    - <b>attention to detail</b>\n\n\n
    <u>App development can focus more on design, user experience and sometimes entertaining features, while software programming has as main target finding and introducing the right codes and making sure the standard of quality is met.</u>
\n\n\n
    Here are the main courses you can expect from a Bachelor\’s in App Development vs. one in Software programming:
\n\n

    <i>If you want to become a professional developer or programmer, you need to start with getting a Computer Science degree.
</i> \n\n
\tMany app developers have graduated from <b>computer graphics, web development, computing</b> and <b>digital media</b> Bachelors. These programmes usually include topics related to <u>data mining</u>, <u>software architectures</u>, <u>mobile communications</u>, <u>interaction design</u>.\n\n

    Bachelors in Video Games &amp; Multimedia in Sweden\n
    Bachelors in Video Games &amp; Multimedia in Canada\n
    Bachelors in Video Games &amp; Multimedia in the U.S.\n
    Also check out online Bachelors in Video Games &amp; Multimedia.\n\n\n

\tIn case you\’re more inclined towards software programming, here, things are pretty clear because you will find plenty of Bachelor\’s degree courses entitled exactly \”software programming\” or \”software engineering\”. These courses focus on programming, computer systems, advanced software modelling, numerical methods, ethics in computing.\n\n

    Bachelors in Software Programming in Finland\n
    Bachelors in Software Programming in the Netherlands\n
    Bachelors in Software Programming in Germany\n\n\n


\tWhether you choose to be an app developer or a software programmer, your work will be greatly rewarded on a personal level and in terms of your monthly pay-check as well.\n\n

\tSpeaking of salary, there is almost no difference so app developers and software programmers are almost equally paid, depending of course, on the years of experience and the location:\n\n

    Average salary of a software engineer in the US: 78,000 USD/year\n
    Average salary of an app developer in the US: 66,000 USD/year\n
    Average salary of both app developers and software programmers in the UK: 30,700 GBP/year\n
    Like any science and technology experts, developers and software engineers will always be in demand and it\’s highly \nlikely the demand will increase. The number of apps will continue to rise and there will always be the need for people who create new computer programs and find solutions for various software issues.\n\n\n</string>

        <b>Introduction to Photography: <i>The Universal Language</i></b>\n\n
    What you need to know about photography. Why you need to know it.\n

   <b> BY SPENCER COX</b>
\n\n\n
\tThis introduction to photography is written for beginners, with several tips and suggestions to take your skills as far as possible. However, writing an introduction to photography is like writing an introduction to words; as amazing and important as it is, photography can be almost limitlessly complex. What separates inspiring photographs from ordinary ones, and how can you improve the quality of your own work\? This article lays a foundation to answer to those questions and more.
\n\n
    What Is Photography\?\n
\tPhotography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.\n\n

    Do You Need a Fancy Camera\?\n
    Apple became the world\’s first trillion dollar company in 2018 largely because of the iPhone – and what it replaced.
\n
    Alarm clocks. Flashlights. Calculators. MP3 players. Landline phones. GPSs. Audio recorders.
\n
    Cameras.
\n
\tMany people today believe that their phone is good enough for most photography, and they have no need to buy a separate camera. And you know what\? They\’re not wrong. For most people out there, a dedicated camera is overkill.
\n
\tPhones are better than dedicated cameras for most people\’s needs. They\’re quicker and easier to use, not to mention their seamless integration with social media. It only makes sense to get a dedicated camera if your phone isn\’t good enough for the photos you want (like photographing sports or low-light environments) or if you\’re specifically interested in photography as a hobby.
\n
\tThat advice may sound crazy coming from a photographer, but it\’s true. If you have any camera at all, especially a cell phone camera, you have what you need for photography. And if you have a more advanced camera, like a DSLR or mirrorless camera, what more is there to say\? Your tools are up to the challenge. All that\’s left is to learn how to use them.
\n
\tWhat Is the Bare Minimum Gear Needed for Photography\?
    <b>Camera</b>. If you buy a dedicated camera (rather than a phone), pick one with interchangeable lenses so that you can try out different types of photography more easily. Read reviews, but don\’t obsess over them, because everything available today is pretty much equally good as its competition. Find a nice deal and move on.
\n\n
    <b>Lenses</b>. This is where it counts. For everyday photography, start with a standard zoom lens like a 24-70mm or 18-55mm. For portrait photography, pick a prime lens (one that doesn\’t zoom) at 35mm, 50mm, or 85mm. For sports, go with a telephoto lens. For macro photography, get a dedicated macro lens. And so on. Lenses matter more than any other piece of equipment because they determine what photos you can take in the first place.
\n\n
    <b>Post-processing</b> software. One way or another, you need to edit your photos. It\’s ok to start with software already on your computer, or software that comes with your camera. But in the long run, a dedicated program will do a better job. Adobe sells Lightroom and Photoshop as a bundle for $10/month, or you can buy standalone software from another company if you prefer; there are tons of options. Whatever you pick, stick with it for a while, and you\’ll learn it quite well.
\n\n\n
\tEverything else is optional, but can be very helpful:
\n\n
    A <b>tripod</b>. A landscape photographer\’s best friend. See our comprehensive tripod article.
    Bags. Get a shoulder bag for street photography, a rolling bag for studio photography, a technical hiking backpack for landscape photography, and so on.\n\n
    <b>Memory cards</b>. Choose something in the 64-128 GB range to start. Get a fast card (measured in MB/second) if you shoot bursts of photos, since your camera\’s memory will clear faster.
    <b>Extra batteries</b>. Get at least one spare battery to start, preferably two. Off-brand batteries are usually cheaper, although they may not last as long or maintain compatibility with future cameras.
    \n\t<b>Polarizing filter</b>. This is a big one, especially for landscape photographers. Don\’t get a cheap polarizer or it will harm your image quality. We recommend the B+W Kaesemann filter (of the same thread size as your lens). See our polarizing filter article too.\n
\t<b>Flash</b>. Flashes can be expensive, and you might need to buy a separate transmitter and receiver if you want to use your flash off-camera. But for genres like portrait photography or macro photography, they\’re indispensable.
\n\tBetter <b>computer monitor</b>. Ideally, you\’d get an <i>IPS monitor</i> for editing photos (which we\’ve also written an article about). \n\n
\tA <b>color calibration device</b> is also really helpful, so you know you\’re editing the \”correct\” colors.
\n\t<b>Cleaning kit</b>. The top item is a microfiber cloth to keep the front of your lens clean. Also get a rocket blower to remove dust from your camera sensor more easily.\n\n
\t<b>Other equipment</b>. There are countless other photography accessories available, from remote shutter releases to GPS attachments, printers, and more. Don\’t worry about these at first; you\’ll realize over time if you need one.\n\n\n
\n\n\n

    The <b><i>Three Fundamental Camera Settings</i></b> You Should Know: \n\n
\tYour camera has dozens of buttons and menu options, if not hundreds. How do you make sense of all these options\? And how do you do it quickly in the field\?\n\n

\tIt\’s not easy, but it\’s also not as bad you might think. In fact, most of the menu options are things you\’ll only set one time, then rarely or never touch again. Only a handful of settings need to be changed frequently, and that\’s what the rest of this Photography Basics guide covers.
\n
\tThe three most important settings are called <b><i>shutter speed, aperture, and ISO</i></b>. All three of them control the brightness of your photo, although they do so in different ways. In other words, each brings its own \”side effects\” to an image. So, it\’s a bit of an art to know exactly how to balance all three for a given photo.

    \n\n\n


\t<b>Shutter speed</b>: The amount of time your camera sensor is exposed to the outside world while taking a picture. \nChapter 3: Shutter Speed\n\n
\t<b>Aperture</b>: Represents a \”pupil\” in your lens that can open and close to let in different amounts of light. \n
Chapter 4: Aperture\n\n
<b>ISO</b>: Technically a bit more complex behind the scenes, but similar to the sensitivity of film for taking pictures in different lighting conditions. Also similar to brightening or darkening a photo in post-processing.\n\n
\n

\t<b><i>Photography FAQ:</i></b>\n\n
\tThis multi-chapter guide goes into a lot more detail about taking good photos, but you may find that some of your biggest questions can be answered more quickly. Here\’s a quick photography FAQ with some questions we hear all the time:\n\n

\tWhat is the purpose of photography\?\n
\tThe purpose of photography can vary depending on what the photographer is trying to achieve. For example, documentary and news photographers capture images for the purpose of providing detailed account of actual events, while hobbyist photographers aim to capture life moments with their families and friends.\t
\n
\tWhat are the types of photography\?\n
\tThere are many different types of photography, such as landscape, macro, wildlife, portrait, documentary, fashion, travel and event photography. To see a more complete list of types of photography, please refer to this article.
\n\n
\tWhat do you need for photography\?\n
\tTo start taking pictures, all you need is a camera, which can be anything from a basic smartphone to an advanced DSLR or a mirrorless camera. However, photography equipment is not all that important – light, subject, emotion and composition are all critical elements of a successful photograph.
\n\n
\tWhat is the most common type of photography\?\n
\tThere are a number of photography genres that are very popular today. These include portrait, landscape, architecture, fashion, food, sports, wildlife, macro, street, event and documentary photography.
\n\n
\tWhat equipment do I need as a beginner photographer\?\n
\tIf you are just starting out in photography, all you need is a camera that you are comfortable with. The rest of photography equipment is going to be based on your needs. For example, if you want to do landscape photography, you will need a number of different lenses, a tripod and filters. For portrait photography, you will need to invest in a good portrait lens and potentially some lighting equipment.
\n\n
\tWhat is the oldest photograph\?\n
\tThe oldest photograph, \”View from the Window at Le Gras\”, was captured by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 or 1827.
\n\n
\tWho took the first selfie\?\n
\tThe first photographic portrait ever taken was a self-portrait, or a \”selfie\”. It was captured in 1839 by Robert Cornelius, an amateur chemist and photography enthusiast from Philadelphia.
\n\n
\tWhat is a genre in photography\?\n
\tA photography \”genre\” is a type of photography, such as landscape photography, portrait photography, wildlife photography, etc.\n\n
\n\n
<b>How can I learn photography\?</b>
\tYou can learn photography from many books and online resources. A lot of information related to photography can be obtained for free in the forms of articles and videos. This article is a part of photography basics series, which is provided by Photography Life for free to everyone.
\n\n
<b>What makes a great photo\?</b>\n
\tA great photograph should have good light, subject, and composition – the three elements that matter the most in photography. The photographer should have a strong vision, then express it in the most effective way possible, as explained in this article.
\n\n
\t<b>What are the three basic camera settings\?</b>\n
    The three basic camera settings are: <i>aperture</i>, <i>shutter speed</i> and <i>ISO</i>.\n\n

    <b>What is the best type of photography\?</b>\n
\n\tEvery photography genre has its own appeal. Some people like some genres of photography more than others.



    \n\n\n

\n\n
    <i><b>The First Steps on Your Photographic Journey</b></i>\n
    <b>In photography, the technical and the creative go hand in hand.</b>\n\n

\t<b>Remember the Ansel Adams quote from earlier\? \”There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept.\” If the idea behind a photo is weak, using the right camera settings won\’t make it better.</b>\n\n

\tAt the same time, camera settings still matter. In a way, every technical choice is really an artistic choice in disguise. These settings are worth learning. Your understanding of photography will improve tenfold when you understand how camera settings work.\n\n

\tThis is how photos are made.\n\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB10"><b>What is business coaching\?</b>\n\n

\tBusiness coaching has become a common and important practice for CEOs and business owners who want to advance themselves and their companies. Still, many business leaders don\’t truly understand what coaching actually is. In short, business coaching is a collaborative relationship between a business owner or CEO and a professional coach, aimed at strategically developing a successful business. And what does a business coach do\? A coach\’s role—generally, but particularly as we see it at EMyth—is to help you design a vision for your business that aligns with your values and the goals you have for your life. With that vision in hand, they provide you with the guidance, support and accountability you need to set and move through your goals, allowing you to take your business from where it is to where you want it to be.\n\n\n

<b>Why do you need a business coach\?</b>\n\n
    Hiring a business coach is not hiring a low-touch advisor or an industry-specific consultant to come in and fix your business. And there are a lot of people out there calling themselves business coaches who don\’t have any real professional accreditations or associations. It can be hard to know who to trust—not simply when it comes to their methodology or the quality of their training, but also in terms of their approach to business and life in general. Working with a coach is a deeply personal engagement. And on some level, you\’re buying who they are and why they do what they do.\n\n

\tSince 1977 when our founder Michael E. Gerber founded modern business coaching, we\’ve helped tens of thousands of owners transform their businesses with our unique and proven approach. We know what it takes: a trusted partnership and a strategic roadmap that works to systematize every area of your business. \n\n\n

Here\’s what you should expect from a business coaching experience:\n\n


\tBusiness coaching is not consulting, and it\’s not therapy. One common misconception is that business coaches will act more like consultants, doing the work of developing your business for you—they won\’t. Coaches help set direction, and provide feedback, tools, guidance and perspective. They\’re also an accountability factor, which is what we find to be the thing most business owners need—someone to help them stay focused on their goals.\n\n

\tA good business coach doesn\’t simply tell you what to do or listen without giving feedback. A good business coach is someone you can trust—someone who has the ability to diagnose specific and systemic issues in your business, and knows that you have to implement the solutions yourself in order to get real results.\n\n

\tBeing a good listener and smart about business are key characteristics for any coach. They can\’t help you unless they understand what makes a good business good—and a great business great. And to truly be a partner, they must care about people and want to get to know you so they can understand why you went into business in the first place.\n\n

\tGreat coaches are patient. Their job is to help you clarify what needs to happen next, but they wait for you to take those actions. And of course, they hold your feet to the fire on your goals. A great coach lives by one rule: You already have the fundamental ingredient to transform your business—the ability to change how you relate to it.\n\n

\tA great coach has curiosity and courage in equal measure. They use their curiosity to look at every corner of your business to find the root cause for why things are stuck or stagnating. A great coach asks the right questions in the right moments—something they can only do if they have the training and experience. And a great business coach has the courage to be honest with you: They understand that you need to hear the truth (even if it stings a bit), or have you pause and reflect before you jump into action.\n\n

\tIf your business coach can bring these elements of your work together, you\’ll become a better leader. You\’ll see the impact in your business—in the way your business starts to stabilize, grow, and get closer and closer to your vision. You\’ll see the impact in how your employees show up to work. And, you\’ll see the impact in your bottom line, in your customer retention and in how your work changes within the business.\n\n

\tThrough business coaching, your objective is to build a successful business with intention. To do that, you need a structured program to follow. If your coach doesn\’t offer a plan for how to help you build each of the systems and strategies you and your business need—and the order in which you should develop them—you\’re likely to create some critical system gaps in your business. A good coach has a proven program that they stand behind and are prepared to implement.\n\n

\tAt EMyth, we look at coaching through the proverb, \”Give a man a fish and he\’ll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he\’ll eat for a lifetime.\” A great business coach knows that over time, you\’ll need them less and less. Their goal is to give you the right tools to put theory into practice, and to show you how to soon do for yourself what you needed their help with today—the skills to discern and diagnose what your business requires next. Like any good supportive relationship, it\’s a bit of a paradox: The more they help you, the less you need them. A great coach knows this and doesn\’t pretend otherwise to keep their financial relationship with you intact.\n\n

\tFinding a coach is a highly subjective process that depends on several factors and how much each aligns with your priorities. If you\’re looking a coach\’s professional characteristics, here are the most important four to consider:\n\n

    <i>Experience, skill level and training</i>\n
    <i>Approach and philosophy</i>\n
    <i>Certification(s) (or lack thereof)</i>\n
    <i>Program, curriculum or methodology they use</i>\n\n
\tAll of these points are important when choosing a business coach, but personal fit is really at the heart of what makes a business coach the best for you.\n\n


\tIf you\’re ready to work with a coach, we\’re here to help. Or, if you already have a business coach and wonder if they\’re the right fit for you, ask yourself these questions:\n\n

\tDo they meet you where you are\? Do they take the time to celebrate with you, but also be there for you if something really goes wrong\?\n\n
\tDo they know where you\’re headed\? Do they have a proven map that they use to ask the right questions for your business in the specific stage it\’s in\? Don\’t assume they have a real plan or any legitimate training just because they have the word \”coach\” on their business card.\n\n
\tCan they hold a long-term vision while they help you fix the problems that exist in your business today\? Do they notice patterns and trends, or are they just reacting to your daily frustrations\? You want wise counsel, not just quick fixes.\n\n
\tDo they make you more curious\? Their way of thinking about things should be infectious—you should find yourself asking other people the kinds of questions they ask you.\n\n
\tDo they understand what coaching is\? Watch out for consultants in disguise, and amateur therapists without the real training or experience to guide you.\n\n
\tDo they truly hold you accountable\? They should be willing to call you out if you don\’t show up and do the work to make real change.\n\n
\tDo they hide behind lingo, lists or tricks\? It shouldn\’t feel complicated to translate the work you do with your coach into your business and your life—hard maybe, but never complicated or unclear.\n\n
\tA great coach is a lot of things. But most importantly, they\’re a trusted mentor who truly cares about your success and the success of your business. They know that the two are inextricably linked, and that\’s a partnership where everybody wins.\n\n\n</string>


    <string name="SA_stringTB11"><b>What is Tutoring\?</b>\n\n\n
\tTutoring is an age-old practice. The dictionary definition describes a tutor as a person who gives individual, or in some cases small group, instruction. The purpose of tutoring is to help students help themselves, or to assist or guide them to the point at which they become an independent learner, and thus no longer need a tutor. The role of the tutor is diverse.\n\n

\tContent knowledge is an essential ingredient for a tutor; however, to be truly effective, a tutor must combine content knowledge with empathy, honesty and humor. Empathy requires a tutor to \”read\” the emotional states, attitudes and perceptions of their students. Empathy is the ability to see others from their personal frame of reference, and to communicate this understanding to the person involved. In order for tutors to establish a supportive relationship with their students, tutors must be open and honest. Students are often reluctant to talk with a stranger about their academic problems. If a tutor is perceived as genuine and having a strong desire to listen, students will be more willing to open up and discuss their problems. Humor can also play an important part in a tutoring session. Humor can reduce tension. Shared laughter is a powerful way to reinforce learning. Humor can set students at ease and increase rapport. Humor can also be used to compliment, to guide or to provide negative feedback in a positive manner.\n\n

\tIn addition, a successful tutor demonstates a caring attitude. Caring consists of being organized for the tutoring session, being punctual, establishing a learning relationship with the student, developing unique tutoring strategies, and becoming familiar with the learning process. Ultimately, tutoring is sharing yourself with another student in a way that makes a difference in both your lives.\n\n\n

    \t<u>There are many benefits to tutoring.</u>\n\n
   - Heightens sense of competency/adequacy in conforming to new role.\n
   - Encourages higher levels of thinking.\n
   - Permits more advanced students to study below-level material without embarrassment.\n
   - Increases motivation to learn in order to maintain new role.\n
   - Increases ability to manage own learning and study strategies.\n
   - Increases subject specific knowledge.\n
   - Increases related general knowledge.\n

   - Provides more empathy with students.\n
   - There are also many benefits to the students who receive tutoring.\n
   - Offers more individualized, systematic, structured learning experience.\n
   - Provides greater congruence between teacher and learner, closer role model.\n
   - Improves academic performance and personal growth.\n
   - Improves attitude toward subject area.\n
   - Generates stronger effects than other individualized teaching strategies.\n
   - Motivates self-paced and self-directed learning.\n
   - Provides intensive practice for students who need it.\n
   - Improves self esteem.\n
   - There are many benefits to the college.\n

   - Increases positive student interaction.\n
   - Enhances measurable positive changes in attitude towards teaching/learning for the participants.\n
   - Improves educational climate.\n
   - Facilitates ethnic and racial integration.\n
   - Characteristics of Good Tutors\n
   - Intelligence alone does not indicate success as a tutor; but what kind of person, what kind of student you are does. It takes a certain kind of person to be a good tutor.

\n\n\nSome of the characteristics noticeable in good tutors are:\n\n

    <i>A positive outlook</i>: The belief that things can be changed through action.
    \n<i>A desire to help others</i>: The willingness to become involved with people at first hand and in depth.
    \n<i>Empathy</i>: The ability to feel what another person is feeling.
    \n<i>An even disposition</i>: <u>Patience, gentleness, understanding and fairness</u>.
    \n<i>An open mind</i>: A willingness to accept other people and their point of view.
    \n<i>Initiative</i>: The ability to see what needs to be done and to do something about it.
    \nEnthusiasm: A liking for your subject, and a wish to share it with others.
    \nReliability as a worker: <u>Punctual, dependable, steady.</u>


    \n\n\nSummary of What Students Need:\n

    Whether your motivation to get up and move more feels nonexistent, you don\’t know WTH to do at the gym, or you want to level up your workouts—technology has a way to help you out. Meet online personal training, which can give you a kick in the butt to break a sweat or provide a plan for your next big physical feat.\n\n

    But is online personal training just as good as the face-to-face experience\? Is it worth it to pay for a plan you follow from your phone or laptop\? Let these trainers answer all your questions about online personal training, and serve as your guides to finding the best fit for your fitness goals—online or otherwise.\n\n

        <b>What does online personal training include</b>\?\n
    \tLike one-on-one training in person, you can get workouts tailored to your goals and fitness level when you turn to online personal training. But how you actually find a trainer and interact with him or her depends on the method you choose. For example, apps like Trainiac ($50/month) and Future ($150/month) offer access to their own roster of coaches who create customized programs. You share your goals and experience with exercise in the app and a trainer will formulate a plan (often based on exercises in the apps\’ library of moves). You can then send messages back and forth about how the workouts are, well, working for you, plus how your progress is going.\n\n

    \tAnother method of online personal training comes right from a coach. Many trainers expand their offerings outside of a studio or gym, allowing you to take their programs wherever you want. Think of it as the direct-to-consumer training model. The trainer will likely write up a month-long program of exercises, reps, and sets, and provide instructional videos on how to do each move in the program. They\’ll then check in with your progress (virtually) throughout the month and answer any questions or concerns you have along the way. Some trainers also use an app like True Coach, which allows them to connect with clients and provide personalized workouts, without actually meeting face-to-face.\n\n

        <b>What are the benefits of using an online personal trainer</b>\?\n
    \tYou gain many of the same pay-offs you\’d get from in-person personal training when you choose to go virtual, particularly an expert\’s guidance on workouts that will help you reach your goals, says Frances Rinaudo, CSCS, a personal trainer at Focus NYC.\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB13"><b>E-commerce Website</b>\n\n\n
    A website that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service.\n\n

    It\’s tough to imagine daily life without e-commerce. We order food, clothes, and furniture; we register for classes and other online services; we download books, music, and movies; and so much more. E-commerce has taken root and is here to stay.\n\n

    The term \”e-commerce\” simply means the sale of goods or services on the internet. In its most basic form, e-commerce involves electronically transferring funds and data between 2 or more parties. This form of business has evolved quite a bit since its beginnings in the electronic data interchange of the 1960s and the inception of online shopping in the 1990s.\n\n

    In recent years, e-commerce has enjoyed a massive boost from the rise of smartphones, which allow consumers to shop from nearly anywhere. In fact, business experts predicted that mobile e-commerce alone would surpass $284 billion in 2020.\n\n

    <b>What is an e-commerce website\?</b>\n\n
    Much like a traditional physical retail store, e-commerce websites allow consumers and businesses to buy and sell to one another on a designated platform. The main difference between e-commerce and physical commerce, however, is that e-commerce transactions occur entirely over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location.\n\n
\n
  <b><i> Types of e-commerce sites</i></b> \n\n
    The scope of e-commerce is vast, but the types of sites that host electronic transactions can be broken down according to the parties involved.\n\n

    <b><i>Business-to-consumer (B2C):</i></b> Probably the most familiar to the average person, a B2C site enables an exchange of goods or services between a business and a consumer, such as buying a T-shirt from your favorite online shop.
    \n<b><i>Business-to-business (B2B):</i></b> A B2B platform facilitates electronic transactions between two businesses. If you own a company that sells T-shirts, for example, you might buy those shirts from an online wholesaler.
    \n<b><i>Business-to-administration (B2A):</i></b> A B2A site facilitates electronic exchanges between an organization and a public institution, like the website of a company that designed your city\’s web portal, for instance.
    \n<b><i>Consumer-to-consumer (C2C):</i></b> A C2C site, often known as a marketplace, hosts an exchange of goods between 2 or more consumers. Examples include websites like Etsy and eBay.
    \n<b><i>Consumer-to-business (C2B):</i></b> On a C2B site, individuals offer goods or services to businesses. This could be a freelance SEO expert who works with companies in a certain industry or an influencer paid to promote a company\’s products.
    \n<b><i>Consumer-to-administration (C2A): </i></b> Similar to B2A, this type of site allows a consumer to provide information, goods, or services to public administration and governmental organizations—think paying a parking ticket on your city\’s web portal.
   \n\n\n

    <b>Types of products sold via e-commerce</b>\n\n
    The digital component of e-commerce allows sellers to offer a wide range of products, some of which wouldn\’t be possible to sell in a physical location.\n\n

    <b>Physical goods</b>\n

    <b>Items</b> such as <i>clothing, furniture, food, or supplies</i> are tangible products that can be stored in a warehouse. Sellers display goods on their e-commerce website, where consumers can like, save, or purchase them. Upon purchase, the business ships the item to the customer.\n

    <b>Services</b>\n

    <b>E-commerce sites</b> are also a popular way to sell <i>services, like consultations, maintenance, tutoring, lessons</i>, and more. Whether you want to learn to code a website or you\’re looking for an experienced trainer to help fix your dog\’s troublesome barking habit, there\’s no shortage of assistance available online.\n

    <b>Digital products</b>\n

    <b>Digital products</b>  — <i>like online courses, software, podcasts, music, and e-books</i>  are becoming increasingly popular on e-commerce sites as well. The rise of digital products has opened up a new way to learn skills on demand.\n
\n\n
    <b>What should your e-commerce site do</b>\?\n\n


    When it comes to selling goods and services online, there are a few basic functions every e-commerce site should include, such as: \n\n

    <b>Accept orders</b>\n
    \tIf you\’re running a business that sells a product, your e-commerce site must be able to accept orders from your customers. This process can be more complex than you might expect. For each order, your site will need to:
\n\n
    <i><b>Record customer information (name, address, etc.)</b></i>
    \n<i><b>Collect customers\’ acceptance of your terms of service</b></i>
    \n<i><b>Calculate any applicable taxes</b></i>
    \n<i><b>Apply coupons or discounts</b></i>
    \n<i><b>Generate order and tracking numbers</b></i>
    \n<i><b>Share delivery details</b></i>
    \n<i><b>Process billing information</b></i>
    \n<i><b>Provide access to a payment gateway</b></i>
    \n<i><b>Take payments</b></i>\n\n\n
    \n


     There should be a seamless transition from your website to a payment gateway. Typically, payment gateways allow customers to:  \n\n

   <b><i>Select a payment option</i></b>\n
   <b><i>Provide details such as credit card numbers and CVVs</i></b>\n
   <b><i> Use multi-step authentication for secure payments</i></b>\n
   <b><i> Handle shipping and logistics</i></b>\n
   <b><i> Once your site has handled the order and payment process for a customer, the next step is delivery.</i></b>\n\n

    As a seller, your goal is to ensure that customers receive the right product on time and in perfect condition. To help this process along, you can either handle shipping and logistics yourself or use a third-party provider. No matter which method you choose, your website should be able to initiate the process accurately and consistently.\n\n

    Your site will also need to have a process in place for accepting returned items. Also known as reverse logistics, this process is just as important as shipping outbound goods.\n\n
\n
    <b><i>Provide customer service</i></b>\n
    Inevitably, your customers will need to communicate with you about their order or experience. They may need to correct their personal information, make an exchange, or return a faulty product. Your website is where these customers will turn to get in touch with you. The easier you make it for customers to connect—with a contact form or chat service, for example—the easier it will be to solve their problems quickly.

    <b><i>What metrics should you track\?</i></b>\n
    Tracking e-commerce metrics can help you measure success, showing you what\’s working for your customers and what might need some improvement. Most e-commerce platforms have some built-in data tracking, but for truly robust metrics, you\’ll want to connect your website to an analytics platform, such as Google Analytics.

    <b><i> Website traffic</i></b>\n
    Your website traffic is a straightforward measurement of visitors to your site and the number of people who buy something while they\’re there. Traffic often paints a clear picture of the effectiveness of your latest marketing efforts.

     <b><i>Bounce rate</i></b>\n
    Your bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who leave your site after viewing only one page or interacting with just one area of your site. If you see a high bounce rate, consumers probably aren\’t making many purchases, so it\’s important to figure out why they\’re leaving. The problem may come down to marketing, pricing, the layout of your site, or a host of other factors.

     <b><i>Visitor conversion rate</i></b>\n
    The visitor conversion rate captures the percentage of website visitors who become paying customers. Conversion rates are important because they show how effectively you\’re able to persuade folks to make a purchase. When you have a low conversion rate, customers are letting you know that something is missing from your business or your marketing.

     <b><i>Cart abandonment rate</i></b>\n
    Just like in a physical store, an abandoned cart in e-commerce is one that has been filled and deserted by the shopper. While abandoned carts can be frustrating as a seller, they\’re not always a bad sign. Many shoppers use their carts as a wishlist or placeholder as they look around for the right product.

    Regardless, you want customers to re-engage and buy those items in their cart. You can encourage them to complete their purchase by offering a discount or nudging them with a promotional email.

     <b><i>Email subscriber engagement</i></b>\n
    It\’s easy to track how many people are reading your emails—and how many are becoming customers. Monitoring your email subscriber engagement can help you determine which aspects of your email marketing are effective and what might still need some work.

    <b><i> Mobile users</i></b>\n
    Mobile e-commerce has become so prevalent that it\’s even earned its own name—m-commerce. This makes it even more critical for you to track the number of mobile visitors to your site. It\’s also helpful to pay attention to how many of your mobile visitors eventually become customers.

     <b><i>Time spent</i></b>\n
    Looking at the time customers spend on your site can give you valuable insight into their behavior. Are your visitors browsing but not buying\? Maybe your website is appealing, but your price point is too high. Are visitors bouncing almost immediately\? Maybe your site is difficult to navigate.

     <b><i>Pages per visit</i></b>\n
    Another metric that can help unpack customer behavior is pages-per-visit. This measures how many individual pages on your site customers are visiting and can help you measure the effectiveness of your online store.

     <b><i>Building your e-commerce business</i></b>\n
    Starting an e-commerce business takes research, planning, and passion. With the right tools, you can tap into the market of online shoppers seeking products from the comfort of their own homes.\n\n
\n
    Here are steps to follow when you\’re ready to move your venture forward.
\n\n
    Step #1: <b><i>Choose your product</i></b>\n
    Before you get started, make sure you have a clear idea of your niche. Even better, it helps to consider what you want to contribute to the market and begin with a vision of the items you hope to sell.\n\n

    Once you\’ve landed on a specific product or service, take your time and do some research. Start by looking into other businesses in your industry. Pay attention to what they\’re doing well and what you think you could improve on. Carefully examine their business model, marketing techniques, and the functionality of their website. These observations can help shape your own plan.\n\n

    Make sure you also consider the potential for market saturation, the ease (or difficulty) of entry into the market, and what unique needs your product may be able to fill.\n\n

    Step #2:  <b><i>Find your target audience</i></b>\n
    Once you know what you want to sell, it\’s time to identify your target customer. Consider who your ideal buyer is and what qualities they have. It can be helpful to develop a customer persona during this part of the process.
\n\n
    A customer or buyer persona is a fictionalized version of your ideal customer. This persona can help you predict customer behavior and understand your future clients more deeply. Factors you might want to consider when developing a persona are age, location, income level, and personal goals or values. Whether you build detailed personas or not, keeping these qualities in mind can help you predict your real customers\’ online presence and marketing preferences.
\n\n
    Step #3:  <b><i>Validate your product</i></b>\n
    Even with a vision of your product and a clear picture of your target audience, you still have some significant hurdles to clear before you can launch your brand. First, you need to determine whether your idea will be viable in the actual marketplace. You\’ll want to consider both market-based criteria like market size, competitors, and industry trends and product-based criteria like price point, markups, sales tactics, and regulations.
\n\n
    When validating your product, you should come away with a firm understanding of the costs you\’ll face as a business owner. For e-commerce sellers, you often have more flexibility in your pricing since you won\’t have the cost of a storefront or, in the case of digital products, warehouse and manufacturing expenses.
\n\n
    Step #4:  <b><i>Shape your business</i></b>\n
    If your business is centered around a physical product, you\’ll need to establish a model for obtaining, packaging, and shipping your orders. Some of your options include:
\n\n
    <i>Making the product yourself and handling the cost of shipping</i>\n
    <i>Having your product manufactured by another company</i>\n
    <i>Reselling wholesale items at a markup</i>\n
    <i>Dropshipping items by working with a third-party inventory handler</i>\n
    <i>Offering a digital product that eliminates the need for production or shipping</i>\n
    <i>Once you\’ve determined how you\’ll move your product, it\’s time to write a business plan. This plan will be essential to refining your goals and guiding your next steps. Think about the type of business you\’re starting, your product, your ideal customer, your source of income, your staffing needs, and your operations model.</i>\n
\n\n\n
    An effective business plan is often between 15 and 20 pages and includes:\n\n

    An executive summary\n
    Your company overview\n
    Market analysis\n
    Definitions of your product or services\n
    An actionable marketing plan\n
    A plan for logistics\n
    A well-developed financial plan\n\n


    Step #5:  <b><i>Pick a name</i></b>\n
    If you don\’t already have one in mind, your e-commerce store will need a memorable name. A great business name is compelling, descriptive, and one of a kind. Check to make sure your business name is available on your secretary of state\’s website and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website. After you\’ve made a decision, you\’ll want to:
\n\n
    <b>Claim your domain name.</b>\n
    <b>Consult with an attorney to legally register your business as an LLC, corporation, partnership, or proprietorship.</b>\n
    <b>Apply for your employer identification number (EIN) through the IRS.</b>\n
    <b>Apply for any necessary business permits or licenses, including sales tax permits, health and safety permits, and more.</b>

    \n\n
    Step #6: <b><i>Build your website</i></b>\n\n
    After you\’ve created your new business, it\’s finally time to build your e-commerce website. Your goal should be to create a polished website that reflects your new brand\’s values and aesthetics. The basic steps of website-building include:
\n\n
    <b>Purchasing a domain.</b>\n If you haven\’t already, you can buy a custom domain with Mailchimp. This makes it easier for customers to find you and lends credibility to your new site.
   \n <b>Choosing a website builder.</b>\n  Mailchimp makes it easy to design and build the website you\’re envisioning for your brand. The all-in-one platform simplifies the process of creating and promoting your website.
   \n <b>Mapping out your site.</b>\n  Once you\’ve taken the time to explore the website builder and its capabilities, it\’s helpful to create a site map. Focus on making your site easy to navigate and fun to explore.
   \n <b>Designing your aesthetic.</b>\n Take your time establishing a visual package that represents your brand\’s values and culture. Mailchimp\’s flexible tools make it simple to elevate your website design with professional formats and appealing branding.
   \n <b>Building out your pages.</b>\n  Each page on your website should meet the needs of your target audience. Remember that all roads should lead to creating new customers.
   \n <b>Connecting your payment processor.</b>\n  Make sure your website can accept payments before you launch.
   \n <b>Optimizing your SEO.</b>\n  Search engine optimization (SEO) is the key to gaining visibility online. Make sure you\’re using keywords wisely so you can connect with as many customers as possible.
   \n <b>Launching your e-commerce store.</b>\n  Double-check your e-commerce launch checklist before going live with your new online store.
   \n\n\n

    Step #7:<b><i>Develop a marketing strategy</i></b>\n
    Marketing is essential to your store, both before and after you launch, so you\’ll want to make sure you develop a compelling marketing strategy to get the word out.\n\n

    <i>Branch out</i>\n
    When it comes to marketing, it\’s often beneficial to use multiple channels to reach your customers. For example, you could:\n\n

    Promote your blog on your social media channels—and vice versa.\n
    Post on multiple social media channels and see which platform garners the most engagement from your audience.\n
    Partner with influencers or affiliate marketers and provide them with links to shoppable landing pages they can share.\n
    Tweak your SEO strategies\n
    Search engine optimization is an ongoing process. To maintain visibility, focus on developing your site\’s SEO with effective copy, product descriptions, and up-to-date blog posts. Keep in mind that your entire site should align with current SEO standards to maximize your exposure.\n
    Invest in CRM\n
    Customer relationship management, or CRM, is a game-changer for online businesses. A CRM platform can support or handle your e-commerce marketing ventures by gathering important data about demographics and behaviors. In other words, investing in CRM can help you optimize your marketing choices and boost sales.\n\n

    Make the most of email\n
    Email plays a significant role in any marketing efforts because it allows you to connect with people who\’ve already shown interest in your product. Email marketing campaigns are a great way to share exclusive offers, promotions, company updates, and product launch details. You could even add surveys to your email to collect customer feedback and help shape the future of your brand.\n
\n
    Get ready to launch your e-commerce website\n
    The journey to launching your online store isn\’t always easy, but the key is to keep your goals in mind and take the process one step at a time. And with Mailchimp\’s comprehensive tools at your fingertips, you\’ll have everything you need to build—and grow—your new business.\n\n\n\</string>
    <string name="SA_stringTB14"><b>How to Start an Online Thrift Store in 2022</b>\n\n\n
    Did you know that you can start an online thrift store in just nine steps\?\n\n

    Our guide will support you at every stage, from choosing an ecommerce builder, like Wix, all the way to publishing your website and setting it live! Stick with us, and you\’ll feel motivated and empowered to create your online thrift store in no time.
\n\n
    Ready\? Read on to get started!\n

    1. <b><i>Research and find your niche</i></b>\n
    If you\’ve ever been to a thrift store, you know it can be pretty overwhelming. Clothes crammed onto racks, boxes of knick knacks on the floor… You have to sift through a lot of junk to find an item you like.
\n
    You want your online thrift store to give a very different experience. To do this, you need to keep in mind the idea of offering a curated selection of items. This is where you\’re adding value for your customers; you\’re cutting out the \’sifting\’ stage, and bringing the products they want directly.
\n
    Keep the word \’curated\’ front and center in your mind, whenever you\’re developing your thrift store – or choosing your stock. You\’ll want to hone in on a type of product, and if possible, take things even more niche.
\n
    For example, shoes could be the type of product. Men\’s shoes would make this more niche, and \’Retro men\’s sneakers\’ would be better still. Remember: curated, curated, curated. You want your online store to look really put together.\n\n\n
\n
    2. <b><i>Create your brand</i></b>\n
    Now you have an idea of what you want to sell, it\’s time to put some thought into your brand. This isn\’t just your name and logo, although that\’s certainly part of it – on top of that, you\’ll want to put some real thought into your vibe, and your target audience.
\n
    Here are some questions you\’ll want to ask yourself in order to establish this:
\n
    Who is my target audience\? Think gender, age, interests, and lifestyle. Who can you imagine loving your products\?
  \nWhat\’s my USP\? What makes you stand out from other sellers\?
    \nHow will my target audience find my store\? We\’ll cover marketing in more detail later on, but it\’s worth giving some thought to this from the off.

    <b>Choosing a brand name</b>\n
    A good brand name should be short, memorable, and unique. Choosing one is no easy task! You can contact your state\’s business filing agency to check for businesses with the same name in your state, or use this database to search for names trademarked at a national level.
\n
    We\’ll cover how to register a business a little later on, but we recommend the first thing you do is grab the handles you want on any social media sites you plan to use.
\n
    We\’ll also cover promotion and marketing later on, but there\’s no reason to wait until you\’ve set up shop to start this – especially if you\’ll be selling clothing. Start posting images that fit your brand image to create a \’mood board\’ of sorts, and generate a buzz for \’something coming\’. That way, once you launch your store, you won\’t be starting from scratch!\n\n
\n\n
    3. <b><i> Set up shop</i></b>\n

    Of course, you\’ll need at least a few products to actually launch your shop (we\’ll cover sourcing stock in more detail in the next section), but it\’s helpful to think about how you want to sell your products before you even start buying them.
\n
    When it comes to setting up your virtual shop, there are three different routes you can go down:
\n
    <b>Use an ecommerce platform</b>\n
    Ecommerce platforms are the easiest way for new sellers to set up their own website. You select and customize a template (no tech skills required), and pay a small monthly fee to the platform.\n
    \n\n
    Pros\n

    - Easiest and most convenient way for beginners to create their own store\n
    - Dedicated support team on hand to help\n
\n
    Cons\n
    - Depending on the platform, you may have to pay transaction fees\n
    - Self-hosted platforms may work out cheaper (see option 2), although your have to pay for different components (domain, hosting etc) separately\n\n
    \n
    We\’ll say straight off the bat that building an online store the \’traditional\’ way, i.e. by using a CMS, isn\’t something we\’d recommend for beginners. Yes, there\’s \’endless scope for customization\’ – but unless you have a very specific look in mind, chances are this isn\’t something you\’ll benefit much from. It\’ll also take much longer to set up.\n\n


    3.  <b><i>Sell through marketplaces</i></b>\n
    Marketplaces like Etsy, Amazon, and eBay have obvious advantages, but if you\’re serious about making this business a long-term venture, they won\’t have the scalability and brand-building capabilities that you need.\n\n



    4.  <b><i>Source Products</i></b>\n
    Now we get to the really fun part! Well, we think so, anyway. It\’s time to source your stock!
\n
    Don\’t invest too much money in your stock at first – start off with a small collection, so you can get a feel for what\’s selling well before you buy more.
\n\n
    There are a few ways to go about this, and some methods will be ruled out by the type of product you want to stock, so pick and choose as appropriate:
\n
    <b>Thrift stores</b>\n
    <b>Yard/garage sales</b>\n
    <b>Estate sales</b>\n
    <b>eBay</b>\n
    <b>Craigslist</b>\n
    <b>Clearance sales</b>\n
    <b>Flea markets</b>\n\n\n


    Once you see an item that fits your brand criteria, it can be all too tempting to snap it up straight away. But before you go ahead and purchase it, run through the following quick checks:\n\n

    1. <b>Look at the general condition</b>\n
    Check the item for any stains, or signs of wear and tear. Some things can be spruced up easily, but it\’s best to steer clear of items with any real damage or stains.
\n\n
    2. <b>Browse online prices</b>\n
    You\’ve got a great feeling about this item, but what would your customers think\? They say one man\’s trash is another man\’s treasure, and you can get a feel for which camp your item would fall into by looking at how much similar items are selling for online.
\n\n
    3. <b>Check labels and hallmarks</b>\n
    If you\’re selling vintage or antique items, it pays to know your labels. Can you tell the difference between a 70s Laura Ashley label and a 90s one\? Do you know your real Chelsea anchor from its imitators\? Take the time to check these things out in the shop before buying.
\n
    Once you\’ve gathered your \’first collection\’ of items, take them home and give them some serious TLC.
\n
    If you\’ve bought clothes, make sure you wash them, but be very careful when dealing with old or delicate material – it\’s always best to do a quick Google first. If you\’ve bought anything else, give it a wipe down before proceeding.
\n\n
    4. <b>Store your products</b>\n
    So once you have your lovely clean stock ready to sell, you\’ll run into the next question – where should you store it\?
\n
    <i>Where to store your products</i>\n
    When you first start out, a spare room/cupboard/wardrobe/rail should work fine. However, your roommate/parents/significant other/cat probably won\’t take too kindly to having your whole place overrun with stock, so it\’s good to have something more permanent in mind from the start.
\n\n
    <i>Create a storage system</i>\n
    We\’d argue that creating a system for storing and tracking your inventory is as important as finding the space to do it.
\n
    We think it makes most sense to store your stock in a way that matches how it\’s categorized on site. If we take clothing, that probably means splitting it out into mens and womens (if you offer both) and then grouping by season or clothing type. This makes it easy to locate an item when you need to send it off.
\n
    You\’ll also need a system for tracking inventory. This is vital for any ecommerce business, but particularly for thrift and vintage store owners; once your one-of-a-kind product is gone, it really is gone!
\n
    Ecommerce platforms generally have impressive inventory management tools, because part of their appeal is the all-in-one convenience of selling on your own website. And we were particularly impressed by Squarespace\’s features, which include the ability to send automated abandoned cart recovery emails to customers who didn\’t complete their purchase. Squarespace\’s clean, centralized dashboard also makes it easy to organize your products by price, name, or number left in stock.\n\n\n
\n\n

    5. <b>Take great product photos</b>\n
    If you\’ve followed our advice, you should now have a lovely selection of clean stock that you\’re really proud of.
\n
    That\’s why rushing your product photos is a mistake. You don\’t need any fancy equipment to get this right, but you do need to prepare and take the time to get it right.
\n
    We\’ve actually written a whole guide to taking great product photos, so we won\’t go into tons of detail now. Here are some tips to get you started:
\n
    <b>Use lots of light</b>
    A well-lit product makes for a great shot. Natural light is best, but failing that, just put on as many lights as possible, and keep them as close as possible to the product as you don\’t distort the shape.
\n
    Good to know! Flash is not a good substitute for poor lighting, and should be avoided in product photography at all costs.
  \nInvest in a white \’sweep\’ background
  \nWhite is the best color for showing off any product, as it\’s the least distracting. And when we say white, we mean pure white – once you end up with different shades of off white, you\’ll immediately lose that \’put together\’ feel.
\n\n
    If you can, we suggest investing in a big roll of white paper (google \’white backdrop paper\’) which you can roll out behind the subject of your photo. This will give the perfect \’nothingness\’ background, free from the angles you\’d get against a white wall.
\n\n
    Use your smartphone, but go easy on the editing\n
    Modern smartphones have such sophisticated cameras that there\’s little point in investing in something more high tech, especially at first. But steer clear of all filters, and generally edit your images with a very light touch. Once you overdo this, the colors in your images won\’t match up with the products, and your pictures could start to look garish or mismatched.
\n\n
    Go from all angles – yep, even the bad ones!
    \nUnless you\’re showing a very simple product, one image is unlikely to be enough. Aim to take a picture from every side, and go up close for important details or detailing. And don\’t shy away from showing imperfections – honesty is the best policy! Aim for at least four photos for each product.\n\n\n
\n\n
    6. <b>Price your products</b>\n
    <i>Cover your costs</i>\n
    This may sound super basic, but when pricing your products, it\’s important to think about your costs as a whole. Yes, there\’s the price you paid for the item, but you also need to factor in packaging, shipping, any transaction/seller fees, and even a portion of your fixed costs (i.e. costs which won\’t change from month to month, like a website builder subscription or storage unit rent).
\n\n
    <i>Check out the competition</i>\n
    If you\’re selling in a competitive space, you\’ll need competitive pricing to match. If you\’re selling something a little more unique or bespoke, you have a bit more freedom, but it\’s still worth checking what similar items are selling for online.
\n\n
    <i>Know the worth of what you\’re selling</i>\n
    This goes back to knowing your labels and markings. Don\’t accidentally sell something for less than it\’s worth because you didn\’t check properly!\n\n\n

    7. <b>Set up shipping</b>\n
    The last piece of the logistics puzzle is to get a robust shipping system in place. And again, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, we already have a super comprehensive guide to walk you through the finer details of shipping your products, but here are a few key pointers and considerations:
\n\n
    Free vs real-time vs flat shipping\n
    Firstly, you\’ll want to commit to how you\’re charging your shipping – at least to start with.\n\n

    Free shipping can definitely be an enticing option for shoppers, but if you go down this route, make sure you\’re definitely covering the cost of shipping in the cost of your items. We also recommend you set some conditions, such as a minimum order value, and only allow this within the country that you\’re based.\n\n

    With a real-time shipping charge, you\’re basically calculating shipping charges for an order based on the weight and location. Every popular shipping carrier will have a calculator tool that you can use to check this, like this one from FedEx. You can then input a different shipping price for each item, or if you\’re using a website builder like Squarespace, you can set this up to be calculated automatically as the customer goes to check out, based on \’rules\’ and variables that you predetermine. A lot of online marketplaces, Etsy and eBay included, will also offer shipping calculators to make your life easier.
\n\n
    Calculated shipping is a bit more effort, but is helpful for stores selling large items with different weights, like furniture, where the shipping cost will likely vary a lot from item to item. Squarespace\’s Advanced Commerce plan will even automatically calculate shipping rates for different providers, including USPS and FedEx.
\n\n
    A flat shipping rate is the easiest option. This involves calculating a rough average price for your shipping, and then just adding this cost to every delivery as standard. This way, you might lose a little money shipping some large orders, but overall it should all balance out and save you a lot of time and hassle.
\n\n
    Dropping off vs picking up parcels\n
    Look out for carriers which have an option to collect parcels from you, rather than you dropping them off to the drop off point. In the early days, dropping off parcels probably won\’t take up too much time, but it\’s nice to have the option if orders really ramp up later down the line.
\n\n
    Website builders make this especially easy. For example, with Wix you can choose to offer local delivery, standard shipping, and even curbside pickup, and you set your own shipping regions – so you won\’t accidentally end up shipping abroad if you\’re not ready!
\n\n
    Oh, and on a related note – pick a carrier with a drop off point that\’s near to you, or your storage area! The novelty of saving 20¢ per parcel will soon wear off once you\’re schlepping an extra 20 miles each day to drop off your parcels.
\n\n\n
    Here are some popular shipping carriers to compare:
\n\n
    UPS\n
    FedEx\n
    DHL\n
    USPS\n
    Canada Post\n
    Labels and packaging\n
    The best packaging for your product should be lightweight, as close to the size of the product as possible, sturdy, and protective. While branded packaging is a really fun idea, it might be best to stick to the regular stuff until your brand feels a bit more certain and established. You can bulk buy most packaging from sites like Amazon.
\n\n
    Whether you set up your own website or use a marketplace, your shipping labels should be auto generated, and it\’ll just be a question of printing these out.\n\n\n

    8. <b>Create a marketing plan</b>\n
    Building a beautiful store is one thing, but making sure people actually get to see it is another. So with that in mind, marketing isn\’t something you should leave as an afterthought!\n\n\n

    Here are the components you\’ll want to build into a strong marketing plan:
\n\n
    <b>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</b>\n
    Give your site the best possible chance of featuring on page one of Google\’s search results for terms related to your products by helping Google to understand what your site is about, and sending some extra positive signals.
\n\n
    Use a free keyword tool like Google\’s keyword planner to find out popular search terms in your industry, and include these throughout your site
    \nUse a free image compressor to make your image file sizes as small as possible, which in turn will make your site as fast as possible
    \nAdd a blog, and post to it regularly – this could help draw in extra traffic, but also demonstrates that the site is current and being worked on actively
    \nWebsite builders lend a huge helping hand when it comes to SEO. For example, Wix has its very own SEO Wiz tool, which creates a tailored action plan for you to follow to optimize your store. This means that anyone can start optimizing, even if you\’re a total beginner.
\n\n
    <b>Social media</b>\n
    Social media, and particularly Instagram, is probably the most powerful tool at the disposal of any new ecommerce business – particularly one selling to a younger demographic.
\n
    Building your Instagram following should start long before you open your store, or even before you have any stock, when you can start building a \’buzz\’ and reposting images that fit your aesthetic.
\n
    Once you open your shop, post regularly. Show new in stock, behind the scenes pictures of shoots, and just shout about your favorite products. Encourage customers to tag you in pictures of them wearing your clothes, and repost these to your stories.
\n
    You can even use a platform like Squarespace to display your Instagram feed on your website, and tag your store\’s products in your Instagram posts.
\n\n
    <b>Paid marketing</b>\n
    Paid marketing is not essential for your business\’ success, but PPC or social media ads are something you may want to consider a little later down the line. This could be when you\’re sure you have a great structure and system in place, and you have a good feel of what proves popular on your site.\n\n\n

    <b>What Is Affiliate Marketing</b>\?\n\n
    Affiliate marketing is an advertising model in which a company compensates third-party publishers to generate traffic or leads to the company\’s products and services. The third-party publishers are affiliates, and the commission fee incentivizes them to find ways to promote the company.\n
\n\n\n
    <b>KEY TAKEAWAYS</b>\n\n
    Affiliate marketing is a marketing scheme in which a company compensates partners for business created from the affiliate\’s marketing tactics.
    \nDigital marketing, analytics, and cookies have made affiliate marketing a billion-dollar industry.
    \nFirms typically pay affiliates per sale and less frequently by clicks or impressions.
    \nThe three main types of affiliate marketing are <i><b>unattached affiliate marketing, involved affiliate marketing, and related affiliate marketing</b></i>.\n\n


    <b>Understanding Affiliate Marketing</b>\n\n
    The internet has increased the prominence of affiliate marketing. Amazon (AMZN) popularized the practice by creating an affiliate marketing program whereby websites and bloggers put links to the Amazon page for a reviewed or discussed product to receive advertising fees when a purchase is made. In this sense, affiliate marketing is essentially a pay-for-performance marketing program where the act of selling is outsourced across a vast network.\n
    \nAffiliate marketing predates the Internet, but it the world of digital marketing, analytics, and cookies made it a billion-dollar industry. A company running an affiliate marketing program can track the links that bring in leads and, through internal analytics, see how many convert to sales.\n
    \nAn e-commerce merchant wanting to reach a wider base of internet users and shoppers may hire an affiliate. An affiliate could be the owner of multiple websites or email marketing lists; the more websites or email lists that an affiliate has, the wider its network. The hired affiliate then communicates and promotes the products offered on the e-commerce platform to their network. The affiliate does this by running banner ads, text ads, or links on its websites or sending email to clientele. Firms use advertisements in the form of articles, videos, and images to draw an audience\’s attention to a service or product.
\n\n
    Visitors who click the ads or links are redirected to the e-commerce site. If they purchase the product or service, the e-commerce merchant credits the affiliate\’s account with the agreed-upon commission, which could be 5% to 10% of the sales price.\n\n\n
\n\n
    The goal of this model is to increase sales and create a win-win solution for both merchant and affiliate. The system is unique and profitable and becoming increasingly popular.\n\n\n
    \nThe internet and improving technologies are making the model easier to implement. Companies have improved how they track and pay commissions on qualified leads. Being better able to track leads and sales contributes to how they can improve or better position their products.\n\n\n
\n\n
    Those interested in pursuing affiliate marketing will benefit from understanding what\’s involved, as well as advantages and disadvantages. Companies seeking affiliates will benefit from properly vetting and qualifying their partners. Overall, it is a low-cost, effective way of advertising products and services, increasing brand awareness, and expanding a consumer base.\n
\n\n


\n
    <b><i>Types of Affiliate Marketing</i></b>\n\n
    There are three main types of affiliate marketing: <i>unattached affiliate marketing, related affiliate marketing, and involved affiliate marketing</i>.

\n\n\n
    <b>Unattached Affiliate Marketing:</b> This is an advertising model in which the affiliate has no connection to the product or service they are promoting. They have no known related skills or expertise and do not serve as an authority on or make claims about its use. This is the most uninvolved form of affiliate marketing. The lack of attachment to the potential customer and product absolves the affiliate from the duty to recommend or advise.\n
    \n<b>Related Affiliate Marketing:</b> As the name suggests, related affiliate marketing involves the promotion of products or services by an affiliate with some type of relationship to the offering. Generally, the connection is between the affiliate\’s niche and the product or service. The affiliate has enough influence and expertise to generate traffic, and their level of authority makes them a trusted source. The affiliate, however, makes no claims about the use of the product or service.
    \n<b>Involved Affiliate Marketing:</b> This type of marketing establishes a deeper connection between the affiliate and the product or service they\’re promoting. They have used or use the product and are confident that their positive experiences can be shared by others. Their experiences are the advertisements, and they serve as trusted sources of information. On the other hand, because they\’re providing recommendations, their reputation may be compromised with any problems arising from the offering.
    \n\n\n<u>Advantages and Disadvantages of Affiliate Marketing</u>\n\n
    Affiliate marketing can yield great rewards for the advertising company and the affiliate marketer. The company benefits from low-cost advertising and the creative marketing efforts of its affiliates, and the affiliate benefits by earning additional income and incentives. The return on investment for affiliate marketing is high as the company only pays on traffic converted to sales. The cost of advertising, if any, is borne by the affiliate.
\n\n
    The advertising company sets the terms of an affiliate marketing program. Early on, companies largely paid the cost per click (traffic) or cost per mile (impressions) on banner advertisements. As technology evolved, the focus turned to commissions on actual sales or qualified leads. The early affiliate marketing programs were vulnerable to fraud because clicks could be generated by software, as could impressions.
\n\n
    Now, most affiliate programs have strict terms and conditions on how to generate leads. There are also certain banned methods, such as installing adware or spyware that redirect all search queries for a product to an affiliate\’s page. Some affiliate marketing programs go as far as to lay out how a product or service is to be discussed in the content before an affiliate link can be validated.
\n\n
    So an effective affiliate marketing program requires some forethought. The terms and conditions must be clearly spelled out, especially if the contract agreement pays for traffic rather than sales. The potential for fraud in affiliate marketing is possible.
\n\n
    Unscrupulous affiliates can squat on domain names with misspellings and get a commission for the redirect. They can populate online registration forms with fake or stolen information, and they can purchase AdWords on search terms the company already ranks high on, and so on. Even if the terms and conditions are clear, an affiliate marketing program requires that someone monitor affiliates and enforce rules.
\n\n
    In exchange, however, a company can access motivated, creative people, to help sell their products or services to the world.\n\n\n
\n\n\n\n\n
    <b><i>How Do I Become an Affiliate Marketer\?</i></b>\n\n
    To become an affiliate marketer, consider what platform you will use to promote products and/or services.6 Blogs are an effective channel for advertising and promoting as it allows the blogger, serving as an expert, to express an opinion about the offering.
\n\n
    After identifying a platform, find a specific category that you are comfortable with or interested in. A focused segment can better help you attract a dedicated consumer base. Research affiliate programs and choose one or more based on your needs, whether it be earning high commissions or generating more traffic. Lastly, develop solid and interesting content around the offerings and work to increase traffic to your site.
\n\n
    What Is an Example of Affiliate Marketing\?\n
    Buzzfeed is a New York-based digital media company known for viral news and entertainment stories, quizzes, and product reviews. Its Buzzfeed Shopping segment features and reviews different partners\’ products and services. Visitors can read Buzzfeed\’s product reviews and select affiliate links to purchase. Buzzfeed earns a commission from each sale generated from their website.
\n\n
    How Much Money Can You Make as an Affiliate Marketer\?\n\n
    Incomes for affiliate marketers vary, with some making a few hundred dollars and some making six figures. It depends on what is being marketed, how much influence the marketer has, the affiliate\’s reach, and how much time is invested in marketing products. Often, those spending more time marketing the company\’s products will earn more money.\n\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB16"><b>Buying and selling domain names</b> is an exciting adventure that for some seems to conjure up images of finding hidden pirate treasure or guessing the winning combination on the next Powerball. Stories abound of domains that were purchased for $8 dollars 15 years ago being sold today for millions. Of course, that leads the more adventurous of us to wonder, \”How can I do that\?\”
\n\n
    Well, the ocean is big. Your likelihood of cashing in on the <u>motherlode</u> is low, and you\’re liable to waste a lot of time and money chasing after the wrong ships. You need a map or some other advantage to guide you toward that elusive booty.
\n\n
    These five tried-and-true tips for buying and selling domain names for a profit can navigate you to becoming an expert.
\n\n
 \n
   <i>5 tips for buying and selling domain names for profit</i> \n\n
    Here are some tips to get you pointed in the right direction when trying to buy or sell a domain name for profit:\n\n

    <b><i>Narrow your focus.</i></b>\n
    <b><i>Find names that offer real value.</i></b>\n
    <b><i>Check domain availability.</i></b>\n
    <b><i>Evaluate the price.</i></b>\n
    <b><i>Get your domains front and center.</i></b>\n\n\n
    <b>Let\’s dig into each of these tips.</b>\n
\n\n
    1. <b><i>Narrow your focus</i></b>\n\n
    There are millions of domains already registered by someone and endless combinations of available domains to register — especially when you consider the hundreds of new domain name extensions like .app and .club.
\n
    If you plan on buying a domain to resell it, start by narrowing your focus.
\n\n

    What do you know about already that can make this easier\?
\n\n
    Do you know about pets\? Trying getting a .dog or .pet domain name.\n
    Are you in car or home sales\? Consider getting a .car or .realestate domain extension.\n
    Is your profession in education or healthcare\? Check out .education and .doctor options.\n
    Think about some of the spaces you are most familiar with and start your domain name search based on the related keywords.\n
\n\n
    It is much easier to sell a domain you know would be valuable to someone in a particular industry.\n
\n
    You can check the strength of a keyword by using tools like Google Trends and Keyword Planner.\n
\n
    What not to do\n
    <b>Here\’s what you DON\’T want to do</b>: Target prospective buyers based on their perceived economic status, without any insight into the industry you\’re targeting. \”Lawyers seem to do well,\” you think, \”maybe I should start selling names to them.\” So you rush out and buy a bunch of domain names you think would appeal to the law firms you\’ve identified as potential buyers.\n\n

    Without knowledge of the space, you may not know that the American Bar Association and other industry-specific organizations set rules that govern some aspects of legal advertising. You\’re not going to strike gold selling names your target buyers can\’t use.
\n\n
    Understand your audience, and the sales will eventually follow.
\n\n

    You can keep a domain for 10 years and still sell at a considerable profit. While you are waiting for it to sell you can monetize the domain and throw in some SEO, which in turn can justify the cost to the buyer.
\n\n
    Most domains end up paying for themselves so your portfolio won\’t really cost you any money out of pocket.
\n\n
    Remember to focus on the areas you know well and you will be much more successful than buying and selling domains you think would benefit someone in an industry you know little about.

\n\n
    2. <b><i>Find names that offer real value</i></b>\n\n
    Think of ways that the domains you buy would be a valuable asset to the buyer.
\n
    Picture someone who would benefit from buying the domain in a space you are very familiar with. If this was you and someone was trying to sell you this name, would it be beneficial for you to own\? Be honest. If so, why\? If not, why\?
\n
    Use those answers to refine your search for names.
\n
    Let\’s play this out with a real example. Say you\’re familiar with the real estate market in Tempe, Arizona, and you have the opportunity to purchase tempeapartments.com for $200. This might be a good deal. Tempe has a lot of rental property; it\’s a competitive market; and there\’s ample turnover in the apartment space because the city is home to a major university. Ask yourself:
\n
    How much does one month of rent profit a landlord, property manager or other prospective domain buyer\? How about a year\’s worth of rental profit\?\n
    Would you buy this name if you were in the space\? If so, why\?\n
    What kind of domains are landlords, property managers, etc., using\?\n
    How much do they spend on advertising\?\n
    How much would this domain help them to sound authoritative in their space\?\n
    If you can answer these questions with confidence and know this niche well, you probably already have an idea of who to contact and how to make a compelling case for how this domain could help their business grow.\n
\n\n


    3. <b><i>Check domain availability</i></b>\n\n
    Now that you have narrowed down what names you should probably be buying, how do you find them\?
\n
    First, check to see if the names are available to purchase as new registrations. You can buy the domain names immediately if no one owns them.\n\n\n
\n
    If the names are taken (as many probably will be), head over to the aftermarket to buy from people who already own the names or who let them expire because they no longer plan on using them.
\n
    A great place to look is GoDaddy Auctions.
\n
    Use the advanced search option to quickly hone in on the type of names you are interested in. You can narrow the results by price, top-level domain (i.e, .com, .net, .org, .club, etc.), keyword, and many more filters.
\n
    Using this feature will help you quickly sort through the millions of domains on the aftermarket and find the domain names that best fit your end goals.
\n\n

    4. <b><i>Evaluate the price</i></b>\n\n
    Once you have a name in mind, how do you know if the price is fair\?
\n
    I like to use namebio.com to compare the domain I\’m thinking about buying with similar domains that have sold. You can enter the keyword and also use some advanced search features to see a list of names similar to yours, what they actually sold for, and when they sold.
\n
    You can also research current domain sales on venues like <i>GoDaddy Auctions </i> and <i>Afternic</i>.
\n

\n
    Finally, Ron Jackson issues a weekly report on DN Journal that covers the top public sales of the week. You can use all these resources to help you price your domains correctly.
\n
    For a buyer, if you see a domain that you HAVE TO HAVE, snap it up as fast as you can. That might mean making an offer rather than waiting for the auction to end (if that is an option from the seller). You may be able to avoid a bidding war and still get it for a price within your budget.
\n
    For a seller, stay firm on a price but also open your auction up for offers above a certain price. Also look for businesses with a similar domain or businesses that would like to acquire your domain because it reflects their branding.
\n
    Finding opportunities to sell .com domains are considerable when you offer them to the holders of the .org, .net or .info.
\n
    Patience and persistence are key when buying and selling domain names.
\n\n

    Editor\’s note: Price your domains with confidence. With GoDaddy Domain Name Value &amp; Appraisal, you can get the most accurate and comprehensive domain pricing estimates available. We use an exclusive algorithm that relies on both machine learning and real market sales data to estimate domain values. Best of all\? It\’s free.
\n\n
    5. <b><i>Get your domains front and center</i></b>\n
    \n\nThere are many venues to get your domains out in front of the buying public. You want to consider a few things:
\n
    Is the venue trusted and well known\?
    \nIt\’s important to feel confident that you will get paid and that the buyer will get the domain name they paid for.
\n
    Pick a place that has good ratings with recognized bodies such as the Better Business Bureau or licensing from a trusted government source.
\n
    This will make it easier for the buyer to pull the trigger on the domain purchase as well knowing they can trust the brand that is selling the domain.
\n
    A trusted brand is vital when selling a domain.
\n
    Is the distribution network strong\?\n
    The potential to get your domain name in front of the right buyer is vital.\n

    Listing in a distribution network such as Afternic can get your domain name in front of millions of potential buyers each month. Afternic is owned by GoDaddy and it will automatically list it with GoDaddy as well as over 100 other companies such as Network Solutions or Register.com.\n\n

    Do you know people who could benefit from the domain name\? Why not reach out to them and see if they have any interest in using the domain\? If you are working in an area of the domain space you are familiar with, you should be able to convey the value proposition of your domain name for the potential buyer.\n\n

    Keep it short and only approach people you know and think would be interested in the domain for their business.\n\n

    You do not want to start sending spam emails. You want to have conversations with people you know would appreciate the ability to own the domain.\n\n

    Letting a great name you purchased at a fair price to make a profit sit in your account, instead of getting
        it in front of the right buyer, is like finally finding that pirate treasure map but framing it to admire in your living room instead of following it to the booty.\n\n\n</string>
    <string name="SA_stringTB17">What is the <b>Difference Between Bookkeeping and Accounting</b>\?\n\n\n
    In financial parlance, the terms bookkeeping and accounting are almost used interchangeably. However, these concepts are different. While bookkeeping is all about recording of financial transactions, accounting deals with the interpretation, analysis, classification, reporting and summarization of the financial data of a business.\n\n


    <b>What is Bookkeeping</b>?\n
    Bookkeeping is the process of systematic recording and classification of financial transactions of an organisation.
\n
    Bookkeeping is said to be the basis of accounting, whereas accounting forms a part of the broader scope in finance.
\n
    The most important focus of bookkeeping is to maintain an accurate record of all the monetary transactions of a business. Companies use this information to take major investment decisions.
\n
    The bookkeeper maintains bookkeeping records. Accurate bookkeeping is critical for business as it gives a piece of reliable information on the performance of a company.
\n\n
    Bookkeeping process consists of the following steps:
\n
    Identifying a financial transaction\n
    Recording a financial transaction\n
    Preparing a ledger account\n
    Preparing trial balance\n\n


    What is Accounting\?\n
    Accounting is the systematic process of recording, measuring and communicating information about the financial transaction taking place in a business. Accounting helps in determining the financial position of a firm and present the same to stakeholders.
\n
    It helps a business in the short and long term decision making and also conveys the credibility of a company to the market.
\n
    It is also known as the language of business.
\n
    The purpose of accounting is to provide a clear view of financial statements to its users, which includes investors, creditors, employees, and government.
\n
    Let us look at the most important points of difference between bookkeeping and accounting in the following table:

    <string name="SA_stringTB18"><b>Travel plan</b>\n\n\n
    A travel plan is a package of actions designed by a workplace, school or other organisation to encourage safe, healthy and sustainable travel options. By reducing car travel, travel plans can improve health and wellbeing, free up car parking space, and make a positive contribution to the community and the environment. Every travel plan is different, but most successful plans have followed a structured process[1] in their development:
\n
    The term has now largely replaced green transport plan as the accepted UK term for a concept, which first emerged in the US in the 1970s (as site-based transportation demand management) and subsequently transferred to the Netherlands in 1989, where the terms company or commuter mobility management were applied.\n\n
\n
    <b><i> Features</i></b>\n\n

    From the above and other definitions, these common features underpin the concept:[2]
\n\n
    Travel plans are not really an instrument themselves but a delivery mechanism or strategy for other mostly transport-focused measures.\n
    Travel plans are delivered by an additional \’agent\’ that is not a part of the \’traditional\’ transport policy institutional structure.\n
    Travel plans are initiated in two ways by the organisation or by the government.\n
    Travel plans seek to deliver transport and related benefits to the community as well as some more direct organisational benefits to the participating \’delivery agents\’.\n
    Travel plans are, to some extent, site-specific and so tailored to the specific contextual circumstances.\n
    Travel plans deliver, to some extent, a package or a strategy of a wide variety of transport instruments.\n
    They can work well the \’package approach\’ allows complementary tools to be implemented in one go, which means effective but unpopular tools (such as parking restrictions) can be introduced alongside popular but expensive tools (like bus subsidies) to deliver the required benefits whilst cancelling out the negative impacts. Next, the use of the additional \’agent\’ such as a workplace, school or even a football club which means that travel plans replace the largely negative relationship between local authorities and citizens[citation needed] with a more positive relationship (such as between employer and employee or between school and parent/pupil). Finally, the site l-specific nature of travel plans means they are developed at the neighbourhood level and so focus directly on the transport needs of the users in that local area.\n
\n
    The concept works by developing balanced packages of user-focused transport tools in a partnership that seeks to provide meaningful benefits to each of the stakeholders involved: improved travel choices to the individuals; cost savings, happier and healthier staff and better company image to the implementing organisations; additional business opportunities to service providers and congestion reduction and improved air quality to the government.\n
\n
    <b><i>Workplace</i></b>\n
    The UK Department for Transport defines workplace travel plans as a package of measures produced by employers to encourage staff to use alternatives to single-occupancy car use. The first travel Plans in the UK were adopted in Nottingham by Nottinghamshire County Council in 1995. Travel plans are now common in the UK, and are starting to become more common in many places throughout Europe as well as in Australia and New Zealand.
\n\n
    A workplace can choose to develop a travel plan at any time be required to develop a travel plan as a condition of planning consent for an expansion or new development. Typical actions in a workplace travel plan include improving facilities for pedestrians and cyclists (showers, lockers and cycle parking), promotion and subsidy of public transport, and encouraging carpooling, working from home and teleconferencing.\n\n

    <b><i>School</i></b>\n
    Making it safer and easier for children to walk, cycle or catch public transport to school has long-term health benefits, reduces air pollution and traffic congestion, and helps children arrive at school awake, refreshed and ready to learn.
\n
    Because of the many benefits, local councils in the UK, Australia and New Zealand are actively involved in helping schools to develop and implement travel plans. In Canada, a national pilot project running from 2010 to 2012 is designed to bring stakeholders together to build school travel plans collaboratively. Typical actions in a school travel plan include promoting the health benefits of walking, providing more or better pedestrian crossings, tighter enforcement of parking and traffic rules around the school, providing cycle training, and setting up a walking school bus.[3] School travel planning groups like Green Communities Canada also work on a policy level to encourage multi-tiered governmental policies that support active travel.\n

    <b><i>Framework</i></b>\n
    A framework travel plan may be used for speculative development such as a business park where the occupiers of buildings are not known[4] or where there will be multiple occupiers (such as a shared office block).
\n
    <b><i>Other organisations</i></b>\n
    There are many examples of successful travel plans for tertiary campuses. Successful tertiary travel plans are usually prepared with the assistance of the local public transport agency. As well as the initiatives listed for school or workplace travel plans, tertiary travel plans can include a U-pass system for student travel on public transport.\n\n

    The development of travel plans for hospitals is a relatively new and interesting field of travel planning.\n

    <b><i>Planning consent</i></b>\n
    A real-estate developer may be required to provide a travel plan as a condition to gaining planning consent. A typical travel plan for a new development will provide for the promotion of sustainable transport through marketing initiatives and for contributions to public transport and to walking and cycling infrastructure. In the UK, a travel plan can form part of a Section 106 agreement, under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\n\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB19"><b>Cyber Security Consultant: A Complete Overview and Career Path</b>\n\n\n\n\n

    If there\’s one thing upon which we can agree regarding the cybersecurity industry, it\’s that the field has spawned a dizzying array of occupations. There are cybersecurity architects, cybersecurity administrators, cybersecurity analysts, cybersecurity engineers, and even Chief Information Security Officers.
\n
    But how about cybersecurity consultants\? Most everyone knows what a consultant does. They\’re the experts who don\’t work for any single company, but instead hire themselves out to different customers, provide contracted services, and then move on to the next client.
\n
    So, naturally, the cybersecurity field also has consultants. This article provides an overview of the cybersecurity consultant job description, how to become a cybersecurity consultant, and why it\’s a smart career choice. \n\n
\n

\n
   <b><u> What Is a Cybersecurity Consultant, and What Do They Do\?</u> </b> \n
    A cybersecurity consultant doesn\’t work for one company exclusively, but rather is hired by a client to test the organization\’s cybersecurity measures, and then design and implement a better defense. These consultants are sometimes known by different names, such as:
\n\n
   <i>Information security consultant</i>\n
   <i>Computer security consultant</i>\n
   <i>Database security consultant</i>\n
   <i>Network security consultant</i>\n \n\n
    Whichever title they choose, they use their vast knowledge and years of experience to advise, guide, instruct, and help implement better security measures for their clients.\n
\n
     The above definition sheds a little more light on the occupation, but we need to dive into the specifics. What does a cybersecurity consultant do\? Here is a list of their responsibilities, although bear in mind, not every client will want or need them all.
\n\n
    Figure out the best way to defend devices, networks, software, data, and complete information systems against possible intrusion and cyber-attacks
    \nInterview staff and department heads to ascertain specific security concerns and issues
    \nPerform vulnerability testing much like a white hat hacker does, including risk analyses and security assessments
    \nResearch current security standards and systems and the latest authentication protocols
    \nDraw up cost estimates for any needed defense upgrades and identify potential integration issues for IT project managers
    \nPlan, research, and design an all-encompassing, capable security architecture for any IT project
    \nDeliver all test findings via technical reports and white papers
    \nProvide professional supervision for, and guidance to, the in-house security team
    \nDefine, implement, and maintain a fitting corporate security policy for the client\’s organization
    \nReact and respond immediately to any security-related incidents, and then provide a thorough post-event analysis
    \nFollow up with the client by updating and upgrading their security systems as needed
    \nHow Do You Become a Cybersecurity Consultant\?
    \nA cybersecurity consultant has a lot of expectations to meet. The only way such a professional can accomplish all of these tasks is to have the right skills and training. So, how does one go about becoming a cybersecurity consultant\?
\n\n\n
    First, let\’s take a look at the requisites.\n
\n
    1. <b> <i>Education</i></b>\n
    Higher education has no dedicated cybersecurity training curriculum. Instead, would-be cybersecurity consultants would do well earning a bachelor\’s degree in computer science, information technology, cybersecurity, or another related major.
\n
    2. <b> <i>Certification</i></b>\n
    The well-rounded cyber-security training consultant has numerous certifications in many relevant subjects. More on this later.
\n
    3. <b> <i>Work Experience</i></b>\n
    As is true in so many other fields, prior cybersecurity experience goes a long way towards establishing the right credentials. There\’s nothing like hands-on work to show a prospective employer or client that you know what you\’re doing. As a rule, three to five years of working in an IT environment is ideal for cybersecurity consultant jobs.
\n
    4. <b> <i>Soft Skills</i></b>\n
    An effective cybersecurity professional knows how to communicate with both IT-related teams and non-technical people. Building on that, the cybersecurity consultant should possess some leadership skills, especially since it falls on you to implement new policies and procedures. Finally, the consultant needs to be a good negotiator, showing patience and tact when working with people at all levels of the corporate structure.
\n
    5. <b> <i>Hard Skills</i></b>\n
  \n\n

    Finally, every good cybersecurity consultant needs to master these skills:
\n
    <b>Penetration Testing</b>\n
    <b>Acting like a hacker, the consultant needs to see how secure the system is and gauge the vulnerability of the client\’s cyber programs and software.</b>\n
    <b>Ethical Hacking and Coding Practices</b>\n
    <b>Related to the first item, this means having a working knowledge of threat modeling and configurations.</b>\n
    <b>Advanced Persistent Threat Management</b>\n
    <b>This skill covers concepts like phishing, social engineering, and network access control.</b>\n
    <b>Firewall Safety and Management</b>\n
    <b>This skill includes backups, fail-safe features, breach detection, and prevention protocols.</b>\n
    <b>Operating Systems Knowledge</b>\n
     That means Windows, Linus, UNIX, and any new operating systems that eventually get rolled out.\n\n
    <b>Programming Languages</b>\n
    Specifically, those used for storing and processing raw data. In this case, there\’s no such thing as knowing too many programming languages\!\n\n
    <b>Encryption Techniques and Capabilities</b>\n
    <b>Cybersecurity professionals</b> with this skill know how to send and receive data over the internet without falling victim to hacker attacks.\n\n
    <b>Knowledge of Compliance Assessments</b>\n\n
    For example, <i>PCI, HIPAA, NIST, GLBA, and SOX</i>.
    <b>Frameworks Knowledge</b>\n\n
    Like <u>COBIT and ITIL</u>, for instance.\n\n\n


    <b>What Is the Ideal Cybersecurity Consultant\’s Career Path\?</b>\n\n
    Here\’s an example of a workable cybersecurity consultant career path:\n\n

    Get some initial experience in an entry-level Information Technology (IT) or information security position\n
    Rise to the role of a security administrator, analyst, engineer, or auditor\n
    Gain some appropriate information security certifications\n
    Begin your career as a bonafide cybersecurity consultant\n
    The Benefits of Cybersecurity Consultant Certification\n\n
    Earlier, we touched upon certification as a requirement. Let\’s take a closer look at it. A professional gains certification by taking classes on a particular subject, completing all of the assigned work and projects, and then passing the certification exam.\n

    Certification not only imparts knowledge relevant to your career path, but it also tells a prospective employer or the client that you have a solid, working knowledge of the corresponding subject. It reassures everyone that you will be able to carry out the duties that you\’re hired to fulfill in the first place.
\n\n\n
    Here are the top certifications for cybersecurity consultants:
\n\n
    <b><i>CISSP</i></b>. Certified Information Systems Security Professional\n
    <b><i>CPP</i></b>. Certified Protection Professional\n
    <b><i>CSC</i></b>. Certified Security Consultant\n
    <b><i>GIAC</i></b>. Security Certification\n
    <b><i>IAPSC</i></b>. International Association of Professional Security Consultants\n
    <b><i>OSCP</i></b>. Offensive Security Certified Professional\n
    <b><i>PSP</i></b>. Physical Security Professional\n\n\n



    <b>What Does a Cybersecurity Consultant Salary Look Like\?</b>\n
    According to Glassdoor, a cyber-security consultant in India can earn an average of ₹736,257 annually.  Consultants in the United States can expect an annual average of $85,427, while in the United Kingdom, the average is £43,354.
\n\n\n
    <b>Want to Learn More About Certification\?</b>
 \n\n
    For instance, the CISM Certification is a crucial certification for any security professionals who want to manage, design, oversee, and assess enterprise information security. The course, closely aligned with ISACA best practices, enables you to define and design enterprise security architecture, achieve IT compliance and governance, deliver reliable service to customers, and understand how IT security systems contribute to broader business goals and objectives.
\n
    Then there\’s CISSP Certification, considered the gold standard in the field of information security. This training is aligned with (ISC)2 CBK 2018 requirements, teaching you how to become an information assurance professional defining all aspects of IT security, including architecture, design, management, and controls. Most IT security positions prefer or even outright require a CISSP certification, so this one\’s a must\!
\n
    And speaking of essential certifications, the CEH (v10) Certified Ethical Hacking Course is another crucial component of a well-trained cyber-security consultant. This course trains you on the advanced step-by-step methodologies that real hackers use, such as reverse engineering and writing virus codes, enabling you to better protect any corporate infrastructure from data breaches. This course helps you master advanced network packet analysis and system penetration testing techniques so that you can build your network security skillset and defeat hackers at their own game.
\n
    If you\’re already an experienced cybersecurity professional, these certifications are an excellent way of doing a bit of upskilling. You can never know enough about cybersecurity, as there\’s always something new to learn. Stay current and keep your skills sharp.\n\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB20"><b>What Is Online Therapy\?</b>\n\n\n

    <b>What Is Online Therapy\?</b>\n\n
    Online therapy, also known as <i>e-therapy, e-counseling, teletherapy, or cyber-counseling</i>, involves providing mental health services and support over the internet. Services can be offered through email, text messaging, video conferencing, online chat, messaging, or internet phone.
\n
    Online therapy can occur in real-time, such as in phone conversations and text messaging, or in a time-delayed format, such as through email messages. Though this type of therapy has limitations, it is quickly becoming an important resource for a growing number of people.\n\n
\n
    <b>Techniques</b>\n
    The primary tools for communicating in online therapy include:\n

    <b>Email\n
    Mobile device apps\n
    Real-time instant messaging\n
    Telephone\n
    Text-based chats\n
    Video conferencing\n\n\n
    Such services may be accessed via a desktop computer or laptop, but mobile apps are also becoming an increasingly popular option.\n
    Online Therapists</b>\n
    Just as therapists and counselors in the \”real-world\” can have a range of qualifications and licenses, online therapists can also differ considerably in their training and credentials. Though some websites promise a quick and easy path to becoming an online therapist, becoming an online therapist takes the same education and training as becoming a traditional in-person therapist.\n\n
    \n

\n
    However, the actual practice of online therapy is very difficult to regulate since therapists can operate from anywhere in the world making it tough to enforce state laws regulating education, training, and scope of practice.\n
\n

    \nRules and Ethics of Online Therapy
    \nThe American Psychological Association (APA) offers a good ethical framework for the use of technology in mental health. These guidelines suggest the minimum practices and standards required for ethical online therapy:1
\n
    Have a sufficient understanding of technology. This includes how to use the tools required to deliver psychotherapy online and how to ensure that client information remains private and secure.
    \nWork within their Scope of Practice. Therapists should only offer services they are trained to provide. So if you reveal an issue to your therapist that they aren\’t equipped to treat, they should refer you to another therapist instead of trying to tackle it themselves.
    \nSeek out training, knowledge, and supervision. In order to provide the best care possible, most states require therapists stay up-to-date with the latest research and best practices. This can involve attending formal (college or university courses) and informal (workshops and conferences) training sessions, and seeking clinical supervision (either face-to-face or online) when needed.
    \nAdhere to relevant laws and regulations. Different states have different policies and regulations in place to manage virtual medical services. It\’s up to your therapist to know and follow the laws and guidelines specified by their geographic location. For example, in the U.S., only individuals who have received specific training and have passed the required licensing process are legally allowed to call themselves psychologists.
    \n\n\n

    <b><i>What Online Therapy Can Help With</i></b>\n\n\n
    \nSome of the conditions that can be effectively treated with online therapy include:
\n\n<b>
    Addiction\n
    Anger management\n
    Anxiety disorders\n
    Bipolar disorder\n
    Depression\n
    Eating disorders\n
    Interpersonal relationship conflicts\n</b>
    Though e-therapy can be useful for a variety of conditions and complex situations, it\’s not the best option if you have a condition that requires close or direct treatment or in-person intervention.\n\n
    \n\n\n


    <b><i>Benefits of Online Therapy</i></b>\n\n
    Below are just a few reasons why online therapy has become a first-choice for so many:\n

    <b>Accessibility</b>: There can be many physical barriers to getting to therapy. For example, maybe you live in a remote area. Or you don\’t have access to adequate transportation, meaning you have to rely on friends and family to get around. Thanks to technology, you can benefit from therapy regardless of mobility issues.\n
    <b>Affordability</b>: Online therapy eliminates much of the overhead costs associated with a brick-and-mortar location, which allows therapists to offer more affordable treatment options. And don\’t forget, there is no cost associated with \”traveling\” to an online therapy session.\n
    <b>Convenience</b>: E-therapy makes it possible for you to schedule sessions that fit your life. You can schedule them around your work schedule and family obligations.\n
    <b>Privacy</b>: Worried about bumping into your co-worker at a therapist\’s office\? With online therapy, you can enjoy complete privacy. You can schedule your sessions for when you\’re home alone.\n\n\n


    <b>Does Online Therapy Work\?</b>\n\n
    Research suggests that e-therapy is just as effective as traditional face-to-face therapy.\n

    In one study, researchers found that when combined with clinical care, online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can effectively treat depression, anxiety, and illness-related emotional distress.3
\n
    According to some, e-counseling may even be more effective than in-person therapy. A review of 17 studies found that online CBT was more effective than face-to-face CBT at reducing the severity of depression symptoms.4
\n
    While online therapy presents some challenges, it has received support from many patients who have utilized online mental health treatments. In a review of studies published in the journal World Journal of Psychiatry, patients receiving mental health treatment through video conferencing reported \”high levels of satisfaction.\”\n\n
\n
\n
    <b>How Much Does Online Therapy Cost\?</b>\n
    Online therapy is generally considered more affordable than traditional in-person therapy. Most in-person therapists charge between $75 and $150 per session. Since most therapists recommend you see them once a week, you can end up paying $300 to $600 per month.
\n
    Not only are e-therapy sessions typically cheaper than face-to-face sessions, but e-counseling is commonly based on a subscription model. This means you pay the same rate regardless of how often you correspond with your therapist.\n\n\n
\n
    \n\n\n

    <b><i>Things to Consider</i></b>\n
    Research increasingly suggests that online therapy can be an effective option, but that doesn\’t mean that it\’s right for everyone. More serious forms of mental illness, including substance use disorders and psychiatric conditions including severe depression and schizophrenia, typically require more than online treatment can provide alone.
\n\n
    Consider talking to your doctor about whether e-therapy is right for your situation or if you should only use it as a supplement to more traditional treatment options. If you think that e-counseling might be right for you, research some sites and apps that are available to determine which one is right for your needs and budget.
\n\n
    <b><i>How to Get Started</i></b>\n
    If you think online therapy may be the right fit for you, consider the following questions:
\n\n
    Do you want a subscription service that allows unlimited messaging or would you rather schedule and pay for therapy sessions as you need them\?\n
    Does your online platform of choice accept your health insurance\?\n
    Can you choose your own therapist or is a therapist selected for you\?\n
    How would you like to communicate with your therapist: instant messaging, live video appointments, or phone calls\? \n\n\nREGISTER WITH EMPLOYEE\’S STATE INSURANCE CORPORATION (ESIC)</string>


    <string name="SA_stringTB21"><b>Video production</b> is the process of producing video content for video. It is the equivalent of filmmaking, but with video recorded either as analog signals on videotape, digitally in video tape or as computer files stored on optical discs, hard drives, SSDs, magnetic tape or memory cards instead of film stock. There are three stages of video production: pre-production, production (also known as principal photography), and post-production. Pre-production involves all of the planning aspects of the video production process before filming begins. This includes scriptwriting, scheduling, logistics, and other administrative duties. Production is the phase of video production which captures the video content (electronic moving images) and involves filming the subject(s) of the video. Post-production is the action of selectively combining those video clips through video editing into a finished product that tells a story or communicates a message in either a live event setting (live production), or after an event has occurred (post-production).
\n
    Currently, the majority of video content is captured through electronic media like an SD card for consumer grade cameras, or on solid state storage and flash storage for professional grade cameras. Video content that is distributed digitally on the internet often appears in common formats such as the MPEG container format (.mpeg, .mpg, .mp4), QuickTime (.mov), Audio Video Interleave (.avi), Windows Media Video (.wmv), and DivX (.avi, .divx).\n\n\n
\n
\n
    <b>Types of videos</b>\n
    There are many different types of video production. The most common include film and TV production, television commercials, internet commercials, corporate videos, product videos, customer testimonial videos, marketing videos, event videos, wedding videos. The term \”Video Production\” is reserved only for content creation that is taken through all phases of production (Pre-production, Production, and Post-production) and created with a specific audience in mind. A person filming a concert, or their child\’s band recital with a smartphone or video camera for the sole purpose of capturing the memory would fall under the category of \”home movies\” not video production.
\n
    <b><i>Production scale</i></b>\n
    Production scale is determined by crew size and not the location of the production, or the type of content captured. Crew size in most cases will determine a projects quality and is not a limitation of what kind of content can be captured. There are feature films that have been captured by a crew of just 2 people, and corporate videos that leverage teams of 10 or more.\n\n

    Some examples of <b>production scale</b> include:\n

    A solo camera operator with a professional video camera in a single-camera setup (aka a \”one-man band\”).\n
    A small crew of 2 people, one for operating the camera and one for capturing audio.\n
    A multiple-camera setup shoot with multiple camera operators and a small crew with support staff.\n
    A larger scale production with a crew of 5 or more people and a trailer or production truck\n\n\n

    <i><b>Shooting styles and techniques</b></i>\n\n

    The same shooting styles used in filmmaking can also be used in video production. There is not a singular type of style that is used for every kind of video content captured. Instead, style changes depending on the type of video being created, and the desired tone and message of the video.
\n\n
    <i>Tripods for a stable shots (also called a locked down shot)\n
    Hand-held for a more energetic and jittery feel - often used to depict natural movement\n
    Non-leveled camera angles see Dutch angle\n
    Whip pan and Whip zoom\n
    Vertical motion shots using a jib or crane often in the beginning or ends of videos\n
    Steadicam for smooth movement and tracking shots at slower speeds such as moving through rooms or following actors and action.\n
    3-axis stabilized gimbal for smooth motion shots at any speed. The gimbal compensates for the camera operators movements much like a steadicam but through electronic motors instead of through inertia. The gimbal allows for operators to move much more freely than a steadicam because of the considerably smaller amount of weight used in a gimbal setup. Gimbals can access many places that would be impossible for a steadicam because of this added portability.\n
    </i>
   \n\n\n


    Main article: <b>Corporate video</b>\n
    Corporate videos production can be scripted and covers a wide range of purposes from corporate Communication, Training and Education, videotaping conferences and conventions, products and services, and sales. The most common type of corporate video is the \”Corporate Overview Video,\” which introduces the company\’s executive team and puts a name and face to the people incharge. This video is used as a way to communicate a company\’s core beliefs and values as well as their overall mission statement. This video is often called the \”foundation\” of a company\’s video content as it sets the tone and communication style for all of their other video content.
\n\n
    <b>Corporate event videos</b>\n
    Corporate event videos occur at conventions or trade shows and cover the multiple-day event including speakers, break-out sessions, awards ceremonies and local recreational activities in which the conventioneers participate. An on-site editor then creates a short video presentation that is shown before the close of the convention. Many national or international companies also take advantage of the convention venue to gather interviews of their key employees or customers to speak on the company\’s behalf as it is much easier to film everyone at a central location.
\n\n
    <b>Product videos</b>\n
    Product videos are created with the main purpose of selling a product and offer an opportunity to communicate all of the highlights and features of a product which are typically written on the product page in text but with the added bonus of showcasing glamour shots of the product. The most effective product videos are typically between 2 and 3 minutes in duration, balancing the amount of information provided while keeping the audience engaged.
\n\n
    <b>Television broadcast</b>\n
    Two styles of producing video are ENG (Electronic news-gathering) and EFP (Electronic field production).\n

    Television broadcast productions include television commercials, infomercials, newscasts, variety shows, game shows, live television[clarification needed] documentaries, news magazines, sitcoms, and reality shows, among others.[citation needed]
\n
    Shows can be distributed by broadcast syndication. SP video production was the broadcast television standard from the early 1980s up until the beginning of the 21st century, when many television stations began using digital media to shoot, transmit, and store High-definition (HD) footage.[citation needed]
\n
    <b>Event video</b>
    Main article: Event videography
    Video production can be used at <i>sporting, school, stage, wedding, church</i>, and similar events to provide recordings of the events. Event video productions range in distribution from a wedding video that is custom made for a bride and groom and their immediate family and friends, to a dance recital where dozens to hundreds of videos are sold to individual dancers. Event video production can also be used to broadcast events live to viewers at home such as a press conference or concert. Video of live events can be sent by microwave or a satellite truck from the event location to a television studio in order to be broadcast. Event video usually refers to video made on an event, and has some sort of currency.\n\n


    <b>Video production</b> for distance education is the process of capturing, editing, and presenting educational material specifically for use in on-line education. Teachers integrate best practice teaching techniques to create scripts, organize content, capture video footage, edit footage using computer based video editing software to deliver final educational material over the Internet. It differs from other types of video production in at least three ways:[3]
\n\n
    It augments traditional teaching tools used in on-line educational programs.
    \nIt may incorporate motion video with sound, computer animations, stills, and other digital media.
    \nCapture of content may include use of cell phone integrated cameras and extend to commercial high-definition Broadcast quality cameras.
    \nThe primary purpose of using video in distance education is to improve understanding and comprehension in a synchronous or asynchronous manner.
\n\n
    Webcasting is also being used in education for distance learning projects; one innovative use was the DiveLive programs.\n\n

    For example, Nautilus Productions details an exploration of a notable shipwreck:\n\n

    \”In the fall of 2000 Rick Allen\’s Nautilus Productions co-produced with Bill Lovin of Marine Grafics a groundbreaking, week long live internet broadcast known as QAR DiveLive from the Blackbeard wreck site. For the first time ever, live video and audio was broadcast from an underwater archaeological site to the World Wide Web. Students were able to watch the underwater archaeology in real time and ask questions of the scientists exploring the shipwreck. The twice-daily live distance learning programs reached an estimated 1600 students from as far away as Canada during the five days of broadcasting. In October of 2001 Allen and Lovin again co-produced QAR DiveLive 2001. This time the interactive webcasts from the seafloor and conservation laboratories of the Queen Anne\’s Revenge Shipwreck Project reached over 3600 students and another 2700 remote viewers from fifteen states and 2 countries during the five days of broadcasts.\”\n\n
\n
    <b>Internet video production</b>\n\n

    <b><i>Increasing internet speeds, the transition to digital from physical formats such as tape to file-based media and the availability of cloud-based video services has increased use of the internet to provision services previously delivered on-premise in the context of commercial content creation for example video editing. In some cases the lower costs of equivalent services in the cloud has driven adoption and in others the greater scope for collaboration and time savings.</i></b>
    \n\n

    Many web sites include videos. Although not necessarily produced online, many video production tools allow the production of videos without actually using a physical camera. An example of this is using the YouTube video editor to create a video using pre-existing video content that is held on the platform under Creative Commons license.[citation needed]
\n\n
    Video content is being used in an ever-growing range of contexts, including testimonial videos, web presenter videos, help section videos, interviews, parodies, product demonstrations, training videos, thank you videos, and apology videos.
\n\n
    Marketing videos are made on the basis of the campaign target. Explainer videos are used for explaining a product, commercial videos for introducing a company, sales videos for selling a product, and social media videos for brand awareness.
\n\n
    Individual Internet marketing videos are primarily produced in-house and by small media agencies, while a large volume of videos are produced by big media companies, crowdsourced production marketplaces, or in scalable video production platforms.[8]
\n\n
    Most Internet marketing videos serve the purpose of interacting with the audience. The two main types of internet marketing videos are transactional videos, which aim to sell a product to a customer, and reference videos, which are designed to keep the customer on the site.\n\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB22"><b>What is digital advertising\? A beginner\’s guide</b>\n\n\n


    <b><i>What is digital advertising\?</i></b>\n
    Digital advertising refers to marketing through online channels, such as websites, streaming content, and more. Digital ads span media formats, including text, image, audio, and video. They can help you achieve a variety of business goals across the marketing funnel, ranging from brand awareness to customer engagement, to launching new products and driving repeat sales.
\n\n
    The field of digital advertising is relatively young, in comparison to traditional channels such as magazines, billboards, and direct mail. The evolution of advertising isn\’t just about what the ads look like or where they appear, but also the ways they\’re built, sold, and measured.
\n\n


    Differences between <i>digital advertising and traditional advertising</i>\n
    The primary differences between digital advertising and traditional advertising are flexibility and precision.
\n\n
    <b>Flexibility</b>\n
    One example of flexibility is how quickly digital ads can go live. The process of printing and distributing ads through traditional channels—sending out newspapers, painting a billboard—can take a significant amount of time. In contrast, digital advertising can have a much shorter lead time, showing up on a website almost immediately after the ad is created. For ads that are automatically generated based on a standard template, the process can take literally a few minutes.
\n\n
    Unlike print advertising, where an ad can\’t be changed once it\’s been published, digital ads are flexible even after the campaign is live. Depending on the specific channel, it may be possible to adjust the creative content, timing and frequency, targeting, and more. This allows for in-flight optimization where you can make adjustments to ad campaigns based on how they are performing.
\n\n
    Digital advertising is also extremely flexible in terms of budget. Complex and high-profile digital advertising campaigns may be just as expensive as traditional advertising—or more—but digital ads are also accessible to smaller businesses without significant budgets, and may scale up or down to match your financial investment.
\n\n
    <b>Precision</b>
    Another key difference between digital advertising and traditional advertising is precision. Traditional ads in magazines, on TV, or on billboards reach anyone who sees them. In contrast, digital advertising lets you use different methods of targeting in order to be more precise and reach audiences who are more likely to be interested in your ad. For instance, if you sell outdoors equipment, you may choose to reach audiences who are interested in hiking, or reengage shoppers who have browsed your products but not yet purchased. Depending on the format, you may also choose to limit your ad to certain times of day, or exclude audiences who have already viewed your ad once from seeing it again.
\n\n
    <b><i>Why is digital advertising important\?</i></b>\n
    There are many reasons that digital ads are a crucial part of any business\’s marketing strategy. Maybe the most important one is that consumers are spending more and more time connected to the Internet through their computers, smartphones, and smart home devices. The average American has access to more than 10 connected devices in their household.1 Digital marketing allows you to meet audiences where they are.
\n\n
    People make decisions about the goods and services they buy at all times of the day, during all kinds of activities. With digital ads, you can reach audiences when they are browsing online for products to buy. Or you might reach them when they\’re streaming a TV show, visiting a favorite website, or using social media. Even if they don\’t choose to purchase from you in that moment, reaching them in these different contexts can help them remember your brand later on, when they\’re ready to purchase.
\n\n
    <b><i> What are the different types of digital advertising\?</i></b>\n\n
    There are multiple types of advertising formats in digital marketing. These are some of the most common:\n\n

    <b>Search advertising</b>\n

    <b> Search ads, also called search engine marketing (SEM), appear in search engine results pages (SERPs). These are typically text ads that appear above or alongside organic search results.\n
</b>\n
    <b>  Display advertising</b>\n

    <b>Display ads are online ads that use text and visual elements, such as an image or animation, and can appear on websites, apps, and devices. They appear in or alongside the content of a website.\n

        <b>Display ads are online ads that use text and visual elements, such as an image or animation, and can appear on websites, apps, and devices. They appear in or alongside the content of a website.
</b>\n\n
        <b>nStreaming media advertising</b> \n

    Also known as <i>over-the-top (OTT)</i>, these are a specific type of video ad that appears in streaming media content delivered over the Internet without satellite or cable.
\n
    In the context of digital advertising, audio ads are ads that play before, during, or after online audio content, such as streaming music or podcasts.
\n\n
        <b>Social media advertising</b>\n

    Social media ads appear in social media platforms, such as Twitter or LinkedIn.
\n\n
        <b>How do digital ads work\?</b>\n
    There is no one answer to the question, \”How do digital ads work\?\” With the wide variety of digital ad formats, you can find ads that are simple to create and publish, as well as ads that require more complex tools. There are also ad types for all levels of budget, with different pricing models and targeting methods.
\n\n
        <b>Publishing digital ads</b>\n
    How digital ads are published is determined by the specific type of ad. With some ads, you can purchase advertising inventory—the space for ads on a given website, or publisher—directly from the publisher. For example, Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products are ads that appear only on Amazon.
\n\n
    Digital ads can also be purchased programmatically. Programmatic advertising is the automated buying and selling of digital advertising inventory, including display advertising and video advertising. You can use a demand-side platform (DSP), which is software that automates purchasing and management of digital advertising inventory from multiple publishers. A supply-side platform or sell-side platform (SSP) is software used by publishers to automate the sale and management of their advertising inventory.
\n\n
    <b>Cost of digital advertising</b>\n
    The cost of digital advertising also varies by format. A common type of pricing is cost-per-click (CPC), or pay-per-click (PPC), which is a pricing model where you pay each time someone clicks your ad. Another type is cost-per-mille (CPM), which means cost-per-thousand-impressions. This is a pricing model where you pay a certain amount for 1,000 impressions, or times your ad appears.
\n\n
    You might also pay using other models, such as paying each time your ad leads to a desired action (e.g., someone signs up for your email list or downloads your eBook). Because digital advertising can be measured in so many different ways—how often an ad appears, is clicked, leads to a sale, and more—pricing can be tailored to the intended function of the ad.
\n\n
    <b>Targeting for digital ads</b>\n
    As mentioned above, digital advertising is much more precise than more traditional forms of advertising. There are a variety of ways that ads are matched with audiences, depending on the type of ad. Search ads are targeted to specific search terms. Ads can also be matched based on shopping signals, such as audiences who have purchased products related to yours, or indicated interest in the type of product you sell.
\n\n
    The result of this robust matching ability is that audiences can see ads that are more likely to be relevant for them. Reaching relevant audiences boosts the success of your digital ads, and keeps you from spending your budget on serving ads to audiences who wouldn\’t be interested in your product or service.
\n\n
    <b>Digital advertising metrics</b>\n\n\n
    Digital ads can be measured in almost every aspect of performance. To measure your digital advertising campaign, you might use these engagement metrics:
\n\n
    <b><i>Clicks</i></b>: How many times your ad is clicked\n
    <b><i>Impressions</i></b>: How many times your ad appears\n
    <b><i>Click-through rate (CTR)</i></b>: The percentage of impressions that result in a click\n
    <b><i>Reach</i></b>: How many viewers are shown your ad\n
    <b><i>Video completion rate</i></b>: How many times viewers who are shown your video ad watch the entire ad\n\n\n
    The following metrics measure the results of your campaign:\n\n

    <b>Conversion rate</b>: How many times customers performed a desired action (click, purchase, subscription) after viewing your ad
    <b>Ad-attributed sales</b>: Purchases that can be traced back to your ad (attribution models vary by ad type and service)
    <b>Return on ad spend (ROAS)</b>: How much revenue was generated by your ad campaign in relation to how much budget you spent
    <b>Return on investment (ROI)</b>: How much net profit you earned from your ad campaign in relation to how much budget you spent
    <b>Advertising cost of sales (ACOS)</b>: The ratio of ad spend to ad-attributed sales
    <b>New-to-brand sales</b>: How many purchases were made by customers who had never bought from you before\n\n\n



    <b><u>Digital advertising best practices and tips</u></b>\n\n
    Digital advertising strategy can be complex, but there are a few key best practices you should start with:\n\n

    <b>Reach the right audience</b>\n
    Take advantage of the precision of digital advertising targeting, so you reach relevant audiences who are more likely to find your ad relevant and engage with it.
\n\n
    <b>Track performance</b>\n
    Performance metrics for digital ads can be tracked closer to real-time than traditional ad formats. Stay up to date on how your ad campaign is performing, so you can see what is working and what isn\’t, and be efficient with your ad spend.
\n\n
    <b>Test and optimize</b>\n
    You can customize nearly every aspect of digital ads, from the copy to the visual assets, which audience segments you\’re reaching, how much your budget is, and more. The best way to find success with your digital ad campaign is to keep testing variables to maximize performance. Make optimization a required part of your campaign execution.
\n\n
    <b>Be authentic</b>\n
    Digital ads continue to become more sophisticated. At the same time, so does your audience. Online audiences are discerning, so low-effort copy or irrelevant ad content will not set you up to succeed. In all aspects of your digital advertising strategy—your visual assets, your messaging, even which audiences you choose to reach—be authentic about what you have to offer, so you can genuinely engage your audience.\n\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB23"><b>How To Write a Coaching Resume (With Sample and Steps)</b>\n\n\n

    Coaches inspire, motivate and improve team performance, whether at a scholastic, collegiate or professional level. An athletic coach resume is an opportunity to highlight those achievements and attract employers and team owners to gain a new position. Knowing what to include can help you create a strong resume that establishes you as a great candidate. In this article, we explore how to write a coaching resume, including what coaching skills to add and a sample coaching resume to inspire you as you craft your own.\n
    \n\n
    <b>What are coaching skills\?</b>\n
    Coaching skills are the qualities and abilities one has that focus on helping individuals and teams improve their performance. As a coach, you often use positive reinforcement to guide learning and improvement through teamwork, leadership and focusing on strengths rather than noting deficits.\n\n\n
\n\n\n
    Here are some examples of coaching skills:\n\n

    <u>Game and scoring rules for multiple sports</u>\n
    <u>Offensive and defensive strategy planning</u>\n
    <u>First aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) certification</u>\n
    <u>Teaching and education</u>\n
    <u>Nutrition and human anatomy knowledge</u>\n
    <u>Fitness equipment, exercise and strength training expertise</u>\n
    <u>Sports injury awareness</u>\n
    <u>Motivation, communication and listening skills</u>\n
    <u>Team leadership</u>\n
    <u>Fundraising and recruitment capabilities</u>\n\n\n

   <b> What coaching skills should you include on your resume\?</b>\n
    On your resume, include a blend of hard and soft skills that support your coaching capabilities. Highlighting both shows you are a well-rounded candidate who can further develop the abilities of others through coaching. Here are the differences between hard and soft skills for coaches:
\n\n
    <b>Hard skills</b>: These are specific to the coaching position, like football defense strategies, observation and analysis, teaching and educational background, coaching methods or firsthand game play experience, like batting, throwing or tackling.\n
    <b>Soft skills</b>: These are more general abilities that universally apply to the coaching role, like strong leadership, relationship and team-building skills, ability to motivate, excellent communication, time management and listening skills.\n\n
    Also check the job description for any specific words, adjectives or skills required and list those in your abilities if they apply to you.\n\n

\n
    <b>How to include coaching skills on your resume</b>\n
    You can incorporate skills on your coaching resume in a few ways, depending on your training and education, work experience and job objectives. Here are six steps for building a strong coaching resume that highlights your coaching skills:
\n\n
    1. <i>Write a professional summary</i>\n
    A professional summary gives hiring managers a quick look at your achievements and sums up your best skills, experiences and accomplishments as they relate to a job opening. You can add a few brief sentences that showcase your strongest achievements and use detail to describe the results.
\n\n
    For example: An energetic basketball coach of 12 years with a passion for improving free throw shot percentages and experience coaching high school and college teams. Holds players to high esteem and promotes positive reinforcement, doubling tryout numbers over four years. Dedicated to student and staff development, proudly securing New York State Division II championship in 2018.
\n\n
    2. <i>Add your education</i>\n
    Highlight your educational background, particularly if you went to school for teaching, coaching or sports-related fields. Include any relevant sports clubs or teams you associated with or played on, and list any awards or achievements in the educational section. For example, make note if coaching became your college major after playing point guard on the high school varsity basketball team.
\n\n
    3. <i>List your experience</i>\n
    In this section, list your work experience or coaching involvement in reverse chronological order. Include the position title, name of employer and dates you worked. Pick the most important duties you performed and try to establish worth of how they helped the team. For example, \”Dedicated to student academics and ensured all players maintained a B+ average or higher,\” is a good way to describe how you influenced team members.
\n\n
    You can include volunteer opportunities, like coaching for a youth soccer league or a neighborhood baseball intramural team if you have less paid coaching positions. If some of your work experience is in another industry or field, include it and relate it back to coaching. For example, a sales manager might incorporate how teamwork and motivational coaching drove revenue numbers up by a certain percentage.
\n\n
    4. <i>Use action verbs</i>\n
    Great coaching candidate resumes often use action verbs, rather than passive verbs, to describe previous responsibilities and show their impact as a coach. Here are some to consider using:
\n\n
    <b>Coach</b>\n
    <b>Teach</b>\n
    <b>Lead</b>\n
    <b>Direct</b>\n
    <b>Instruct</b>\n
    <b>Prepare</b>\n
    <b>Involve</b>\n
    <b>Encourage</b>\n
    <b>Train</b>\n
    <b>Guide</b>\n
    <b>Tutor</b>\n
    <b>Mentor</b>

    \n\n

    5. <i>Add relevant references only</i>\n
    Commonly, resumes only provide references when requested by an employer, but on coaching resumes, it is okay to include relevant references. For example, if you played for or worked with a notable professional coach or for a notable team, list the coach or team owner to attest to your coaching abilities. Be sure to ask permission for the reference.\n\n

\n\n
    6. <i>Proofread</i>\n
    This important step matters, even though it comes at the end of your resume preparation. First, use computer spellcheck programs and then review your full document to check for grammatical or punctuation errors, consistent formatting and accurate contact information and dates. Finally, print out a hard copy and have a friend or colleague look it over.\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB24"><b>Drop shipping</b> is a form of retail business wherein the seller accepts customer orders without keeping stock on hand. Instead, in a form of supply chain management, the seller transfers the orders and their shipment details to either the manufacturer, a wholesaler, another retailer, or a fulfillment house, which then ships the goods directly to the customer. As such, the retailer is responsible for marketing and selling a product, but has little or no control over product quality, storage, inventory management, or shipping.[1] By doing this, it eliminates the costs of maintaining a warehouse – or even a brick and mortar storefront, purchasing and storing inventory, and employing necessary staff for such functions. As in any other form of retail, the seller makes their profit on the difference between an item\’s wholesale and retail price, less any pertinent selling, merchant, or shipping fees accruing to them.\n\n\n
    \n\n


    <b>Procedure</b>\n
    A drop shipping business model does not require a brick and mortar store. It may be eliminated entirely, or combined with drop shipped order fulfillment business model. A physical retailer may keep potential drop shipped items on display, provide details on mail order items via a catalogue, or maintain a website with information available only online. A virtual retailer only has a website.
\n\n
    Drop shipping retailers are not required to disclose the practice, nor, as with any other retailer, the wholesale source of the products they offer. This can be achieved by \”blind shipping\” (shipping merchandise without a return address corresponding to the seller), \”private label shipping\” (having merchandise shipped from the wholesaler with a return address customised to the retailer), or utilising a fulfillment house. The ultimate order fulfiller might also include a customised packing slip, including details such as the retailer\’s company name, logo, and contact information.
\n\n
    In unusual circumstances drop shipping can occur when a small retailer (that typically sells in small quantities to the general public) receives a single large order for a product. The retailer may arrange for the goods to be shipped directly to the customer from the manufacturer or distributor.
\n\n
    Sellers on online auction sites such as eBay also use drop shipping as way of distributing products without handling the stocking the items sold. A seller will list an item as new, and have purchased items shipped directly from the wholesaler to the customer. The seller\’s profit is the difference between the selling and the wholesale prices, minus any pertinent selling, merchant, or shipping fees accruing to them. However, some of the drop shipping methods used by sellers are not allowed under the eBay terms of service. This includes drop shipping methods in which a seller fulfills an order by purchasing the item from another online marketplace and having the item shipped to the customer. Sellers who use this method can be suspended from eBay.[2]
\n\n
    Products may be listed by a drop shipping retailer as available but actually be back-ordered either with the wholesaler or the item\’s manufacturer. Such potential delays in order fulfilment are not always known, or even when known disclosed, by a seller. They also can be extended, beyond the control of the seller. Likewise order fulfilment and shipping delays are beyond the seller\’s control, yet can reflect badly on the purchaser\’s ultimate satisfaction with their transaction. This puts a premium on timely and accurate information provision by the seller on both sides of the purchase, both before and after it is made.\n\n

    \n\n
    <u>In China</u>\n
    Many drop ship companies have emerged in China, many of which offer wholesale and drop shipping services to both companies and individuals.[citation needed] This is largely due to the increasing ease of e-procurement and the growing part that the internet is playing in commerce. Drop ship suppliers based in China have increasingly been able to compete with same-country distributors because of improved logistics for small packets and the easing of trade barriers.[3]
\n\n\n
    <b>Scams</b>\n
    Drop shipping has also been a component of internet-based work-at-home schemes posted on social networking services.[4] Scam artists will promote drop shipping as a work-at-home scheme, in which victims will be sold a list of businesses from which drop shipment orders can be placed. These businesses may not be wholesalers, but other businesses or individuals acting as middlemen between retailers and wholesalers, with no product of their own to sell. These middlemen often charge prices that leave little profit margin for the victim and require a regular fee for use of their services. In 2018, the Gimlet Media podcast Reply All investigated the drop shipping phenomenon, exploring the way drop shippers micro-target[5] their client, but also found that micro-shipping itself is a rather dubious industry in that, despite the promises of some of the most well-known drop shipping proponents, few drop shippers actually make any profits.[6]
\n\n
    In 2016, Buzzfeed News published an article exposing unscrupulous drop shippers in China, describing how customers were receiving products that were not as those were advertised, or not receiving any products at all.[7]
\n\n
    One effect of drop shipping is that customers who receive a drop shipped package will realise that they overpaid for the item, return the item to the seller, then reorder the identical item directly from the manufacturer. The cost of processing the return and the loss of the unsalable returned product can result in significant losses to the drop shipper.[\n\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB25"><b>What is Online Recruitment and What are Its Advantages\?</b>\n\n\n

    <b><i>What is online recruitment\?</i></b>\n\n
    <i>Online recruitment</i> (also known as E-recruitment or internet recruiting) allows businesses to use various internet-based solutions – for example, online advertising, job listings, social media and company websites to source and hire the best candidates.
\n\n
    The prolific use of the internet for recruiting has made it easier to source candidates and conduct interviews as well as process the relevant paperwork required to hire and train candidates. Online recruitment is a way to provide businesses with an efficient and cheaper way to fill positions.
\n\n\n
    In short, the advantages of online recruitment include:\n\n

    <u>Providing your company with a competitive edge.</u>\n
    <u>Online recruitment provides your hiring team with a better applicant pool.</u>\n
    <u>Online recruitment saves time and money by using automation and AI to screen applicants.</u>\n
    <u>Automation from online recruiting can also be used to communicate with a large number of applicants at one time.</u>\n\n\n
    How can our company use online recruitment\?
    <b><i>Company website</i></b>. Your company website is the starting point to showcase your workplace culture and show people that you should be their employer of choice. You can post job listings on your company website and let your applicants know about your company culture. Depending on the size of your business, you can have a simple page dedicated to recruitment or a separate site altogether. To boost the effectiveness of your company website\’s career page, include videos or testimonials from current employees about why they love to work with you.
    <b><i>Internet ad campaigns</i></b>. You can use pay-per-click ads on different search engines, like Google, and also social media platforms to boost awareness of your job openings. These ads can be either in written form or promotional videos. This online recruitment method enables you to widen your reach to get the best candidates.
    <b><i>Social Media</i></b>. Generally, LinkedIn is thought of as a professional social media site and most people would think of it when it comes to recruitment. However, other social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, shouldn\’t be ignored. The type of social media used for online recruitment depends on your candidates\’ demographics. If you\’re looking for professional candidates for leadership roles, LinkedIn is your best bet. However, if you\’re seeking on-demand or hourly workers for retail and the restaurant industry, Twitter and Facebook may be suitable platforms. Instagram is also growing in popularity as a way to market a business overall and recruit online.
    If you want to get some inspiration about how companies are using social media successfully to recruit clients, click here to read this blog.
\n\n
    <b><i>Online job sites</i></b>. Most people ask whether free job boards are still relevant today. However, you only have to look at the popularity of job boards, like Monster, Indeed and Career Builder, to see the thousands of jobs posted. Therefore, the demand for jobs continues to grow. Some of these sites provide an opportunity for employees to share their feedback on what it\’s like to work with a particular company. With online job sites, you can boost your vacancy to appear at the top (by paying a premium).
    <b><i>Dedicated contact sourcing</i></b>. Instead of using general social media, like Facebook and LinkedIn, you can go to specific platforms to hire for specialized roles. For example, GitHub is a platform for web developers. If you have a web developer position or something similar, you can browse GitHub and see the listed portfolios. You then find the email address of the people who you think would be a good fit for your company. This means you can liaise directly with potential candidates and include them in your talent pipeline straight away.\n\n
    \n
    <b>Advantages of online recruitment</b>\n
    What are the advantages of using the internet for recruitment\? There are several advantages of online recruitment, all aimed at a more efficient hiring process and providing better candidate relationship management.
\n\n\n
    Here are some of the benefits of online recruitment:\n\n

    <b><i>Using online recruitment to reduce time to hire</i></b>\n
    Most online recruitment sites use automation that allows companies to start looking at resumes from qualified applicants within minutes of submission.
\n
    The online recruitment system evaluates initial selections according to the criteria specified and they will alert you when an applicant\’s resume meets them. Online recruitment is very different from a conventional newspaper magazine or trade journal job listing. With online recruitment, your adverts are placed in front of the right people 24 hours a day.
\n\n
    To reduce the time to hire, ensure that your applications are mobile-friendly and easy and quick to fill out. Research shows that most applicants will dump an application form if it takes more than five minutes to complete.
 \n\n
    <b><i>Cost effective recruiting method</i></b>\n
    Recruitment costs can add up very quickly. This is because recruiting costs not only take into account the actual expense of sourcing and hiring candidates, but also onboarding, training and retention counts.
\n\n
    Every employee needs to get the proper training and onboarding within a set timeframe to be proficient at their job. If there\’s a high turnover rate within a short amount of time, it means the employee will have left the job without the company recouping their recruitment costs.
\n\n
    The recruitment life cycle will have to begin all over again. Using cost effective recruitment methods significantly reduces the amount you spend. For example, spending money on traditional advertising is very expensive compared to free job boards. Even when signing up for a paid platform, the price will not be as high as advertising in newspapers and magazines.
\n\n
    <b>Reach a wider audience with internet recruiting</b>\n
    With online recruitment, you can reach a more targeted and wider audience. If you\’re recruiting applicants for remote work, you can reach job seekers in any country. You can also use recruiting job boards to specifically target different industries and professional associations to ensure only the right people see and apply for your vacancy.
\n\n
    When using online recruitment, you have the freedom to expand your job search to source the most qualified candidates. This means you can go outside your normal area to reach people from all over the world. You can also narrow down your search. For example, if you\’re a restaurant owner looking for delivery drivers within a certain city, you can tailor your job description to that region. You won\’t have to waste time looking through applications of candidates who live too far away.
\n\n
    <b>Online recruiting increases hiring efficiency</b>\n
    Online recruitment provides technology to improve the full recruitment life cycle. This includes employment pre-screening, background checking, and assessments. The resulting efficiency means that the time it takes to find a qualified applicant is reduced.
\n\n
    One of the advantages of online recruitment is that you can use one modern recruitment solution for a variety of functions.
\n
    For example, Fountain provides a host of features including:
\n
    Integration with third-party vendors to carry out background checks, assessments and pre-employment screening.
    <i>Interview scheduling.\n
    In-depth analytics.\n
        Job posting.</i>\n\n
    You don\’t have to go from system to system because everything is done in one platform.
\n
    Another part of Fountain\’s efficiency is that it saves time in writing great job descriptions. We provide free job description templates for most of the popular jobs. You just edit them according to your company\’s needs and then use them to get the best candidates. In addition, we provide a way to send this job description to the most relevant job platforms without you having to lift a finger.
\n\n
    With Fountain\’s Boost, all you have to do is let us know how many people you want for a job vacancy and your budget for advertising and we\’ll do the rest. We\’ll post your jobs on the most suitable, free and paid platforms to ensure you only get appropriate candidates. This saves time because you get to review all the applications in one simple dashboard. This is online recruitment efficiency at its best.
\n\n
    <b><i>Online recruitment brings more job applicants</i></b>\n
    When using online recruiting, you benefit from more applicants because your job reaches a wider area.\n\n

    Consider that a survey has found that 79% of all people in the US use online resources to search for jobs. The Internet is a go-to resource to find different kinds of jobs. As a company and recruiter, you need to be where your candidates are looking. Submitting your vacancies to the right job boards and recruiting platforms will boost the number of quality applications you receive.
\n\n
    So that the increase in applications doesn\’t slow you down, you need an online recruiting system that ensures only the qualified candidates go through a manual review. Most companies use an applicant tracking system (ATS) to do their preliminary screening.
\n\n
    This means that your ATS will review the resumes that  come through based on keywords and phrases. It will then suggest the resumes that should go through and those that should be dropped from the hiring process. This frees up your time because only the most suitable resumes will be reviewed manually.
\n\n
    <b><i>Recruiting on the internet improves communication</i></b>\n
    It\’s important for your company\’s brand and reputation to have positive interactions with applicants, irrespective of whether they get through the first phase or are shortlisted for an interview. Therefore, you should attempt to communicate with every single applicant who has applied for an open vacancy.
\n\n
    With e-recruitment, this becomes easier and less burdensome as you don\’t need to get on the phone or send individual emails that take a considerable amount of time. Instead, if you use modern hiring software, you can send mass personalized SMS messages to your candidates at once. They will receive your information in SMS, which most people have access to even if they don\’t have Wi-Fi.
\n\n
    Click here to read our blog about how SMS is the chosen method of communication with applicants.
\n\n
    Communication isn\’t only streamlined when it comes to communicating decisions. It also works with online recruitment done by video interviewing. You can use one-way video interviews as a pre-screening tool to save time. A one-way video interview is a great way to assess how a candidate comes across before inviting the individual to a phone or even a face-to-face interview.
\n\n
    Video interviews won\’t be complicated with the right software. With Fountain, a video interview can be recorded directly in the app and sent straight back to you. You and your hiring team can then review the video at your convenience and get back to the applicant about whether they have come to the end of the line of the application process.
\n\n
    Create a better candidate experience with e-recruiting tools\n
    If done correctly, online recruitment can increase the candidate\’s experience and, therefore, their perception of your brand.\n\n

    How you communicate to candidates is very important because, even if they\’re not suitable for your company, they may leave reviews on sites, like GlassDoor, about how you handled the recruitment process.
\n\n
    These reviews hold a lot of power and, if a candidate had a negative experience, they could dissuade someone suitable from applying. Therefore, when using online recruitment, ensure that you treat every candidate, whether successful or not, with respect. Even if a candidate is successful and you\’ve hired them, their experience during hiring will determine whether they stay with your company long-term.
\n\n
    The above online recruitment advantages are clear. However, they can only be realized if you use the right tools and technology. Using modern hiring software, like Fountain, enables you, your hiring team and your candidates to benefit fully from streamlining the recruitment process.\n\n\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB26"><b> Planning and Writing a Grant Proposal</b>: The Basics\nGrant Proposal Writing is Exciting, Imaginative Work\n\n
    \n

    So, you want to write a grant proposal\? This is exciting! This means that you have valuable research to do or a particular nonprofit to build or a community resource you\’re passionate about developing. You have a distinct vision for how something could be improved or advanced, and you\’re ready to ask for funding or other support to help this vision become a reality.\n\n


    \n\n


    As you reach toward this unrealized vision by developing a grant proposal, you should think about successful grant writing as an act of imagination. Professor Kate Vieira, a Curriculum and Instruction professor at UW-Madison with considerable grant writing experience, describes grant proposal writing as a creative process akin to fiction writing—these are works of imagination. Professor Vieira recommends approaching the task of writing a grant proposal with an attitude of wonder and excitement as you strive to turn your ideas into something real. You have a great idea, and you think that you\’re the best person to achieve a specific goal. Now you just need to convince others to get excited about this vision as well.
\n\n
    <b><u>Overview</u></b>\n
    On this page, we offer some ways of thinking about grant proposals and advice about the process of planning and writing a proposal. We consider grant proposals; overall purposes, audiences, and expectations in order to make this information applicable across a range of contexts. However, this general approach has important limits. First, you will need to get more tailored advice about grant writing within your specific discipline or sphere. Second, you\’ll need to follow very carefully the exact instructions about proposals from the granting agencies to which you are applying.
\n\n
    Talk with professors, mentors, previous grant recipients, the funding agency/group you are applying to, and trusted advisers in your field to learn more about what successful grant proposals look like in your situation and to get feedback on your plan and on your drafting process.
\n\n
    Before you start writing your grant proposal, you\’ll want to make sure that you:
\n\n
    <i>develop a specific, meaningful, actionable plan for what you want to do and why you want to do it;</i>\n
    <i>consider how your plan will achieve positive results;</i>\n
    <i>locate a granting organization or source that funds projects like the one you have in mind;</i>\n
    <i>research that organization to make sure that its mission aligns with your plan;</i>\n
    <i>review the organization\’s proposal guidelines;</i>\n and
    <i>examine sample proposals from your department, peers, and/or the organization.</i>\n\n


    When you\’ve done all of this, you\’re ready to start drafting your proposal!
\n\n
    <b><i>Additional Resources about Grants and Grant Writing</i></b>\n
    For students, faculty, or staff at UW–Madison, a great place to learn more about grants, grant proposal writing, and granting institutions is the Grants Information Collection at UW–Madison\’s Memorial Library. Check out their website and our review of some of their materials as well as links to other useful grant resources here.
\n\n
    Considering the Audience, Purpose, and Expectations of a Grant Proposal\n
    A grant proposal is a very clear, direct document written to a particular organization or funding agency with the purpose of persuading the reviewers to provide you with support because: (1) you have an important and fully considered plan to advance a valuable cause, and (2) you are responsible and capable of realizing that plan.
\n\n
    As you begin planning and drafting your grant proposal, ask yourself:\n
\n
    <b>Who is your audience\?</b>\n
    Think about the people from the agency offering this grant who will read this proposal. What are the agency\’s mission and goals\? What are its values\? How is what you want to do aligned with what this agency is all about\? How much do these readers know about what you are interested in\? Let your answers to these questions inform how you present your plan, what vocabulary you use, how much background you provide, and how you frame your goals. In considering your audience, you should think about the kind of information these readers will find to be the most persuasive. Is it numbers\? If so, make sure that you provide and explain your data. Is it testimonials\? Recommendations from other collaborators\? Historical precedent\? Think closely about how you construct your argument in relationship to your readers.\n\n
    <b>What are the particular expectations for this grant\?</b>\n
    Pay attention to everything the granting organization requires of you. Your proposal should adhere exactly to these requirements. If you receive any advice that contradicts the expectations of your particular situation (including from this website), ignore it! Study representative samples of successful proposals in your field or proposals that have received the particular grant you are applying for.\n\n
    <b>How do you establish your credibility\?</b>\n
    Make sure that you present yourself as capable, knowledgeable, and forward thinking. Establish your credibility through the thoroughness of your plan, the intentional way that you present its importance and value, and the knowledge you have of what has already been learned or studied. Appropriately reference any past accomplishments that verify your ability to succeed and your commitment to this project. Outline any partnerships you have built with complementary organizations and individuals.\n\n
    <b>How can you clearly and logically present your plan\?</b>\n
    Make sure that your organization is logical. Divide your proposal into predictable sections and label them with clear headings. Follow exactly the headings and content requirements established by the granting agency\’s call for proposals.Grant proposals are direct and to–the–point. This isn\’t a good place for you to embroider your prose with flowery metaphors or weave in subtle literary allusions. Your language should be uncluttered and concise. Match the concepts and language your readers use and are familiar with. Your readers shouldn\’t have to work hard to understand what you are communicating. For information about writing clear sentences, see this section of our writer\’s handbook. However, use a vivid image, compelling anecdote, or memorable phrase if it conveys the urgency or importance of what you are proposing to do.\n\n
    <b>Common Elements of Grant Proposals</b>\n
    Grant proposals are often organized in distinct sections. These sections have different titles depending on the guidelines specified by the granting organization, but they frequently serve the same purposes. In what follows, we identify some of the main elements of grant proposals, consider the work that section needs to do, and provide tips for successfully composing these sections. However, remember, as you write your proposal, follow that grant\’s guidelines and use the exact section headings provided by the call for proposals.\n\n

    \n\n

    <b>Short Overview</b>\n
    (a.k.a. \”abstract\” or
    \”executive
    summary\”):\n\n
    Here you present the most important elements of your
    proposal in as few sentences as possible. For longer
    proposals, you might be able to use a full page for this
    overview, but for other proposals, you might have to condense
    it to just one paragraph. Either way, make sure that you
    answer:\n\n
    • What is the purpose or goal of your project, the need you\’re
    addressing, or the problem you\’re solving\?\n
    • What are the expected outcomes of your project, and how
    will you achieve them\?\n
    • How will you assess or verify the success of your project\?\n
    • Why is your project important\?\n
    • Briefly, who are you\?\n
\n\n
    Some granting institutions may also want you to clarify in this
    summary the kind and amount of funding or other support you
    are asking for. Let the mission and purpose of the granting
    agency inform your abstract. You might even want to
    incorporate key terms and concepts from the organization\’s
    mission statement into your summary. While the summary or
    abstract may be the first element of your finished proposal, it\’s
    often best to write it last. Wait to tackle this abbreviated
    version of your project until after you\’ve written all the other
    parts.
    \n\n\n
    <b>Examination of a
        Need or Problem</b>
    (a.k.a. \”statement
    of need,\” \”problem
    statement,\”
    \”statement of
    problem,\” \”needs
    assessment,\” or
    \”literature review\”): \n\n
    \n
    Your project is important because it is responding to a gap in
    resources, knowledge, or opportunity that really needs to be
    filled. In order to establish the value of your project, you need
    to clarify the need or problem that your project responds to.
    Early in your proposal, make sure that you establish the
    context of this problem (i.e., the background). If this problem
    affects a particular population, describe that group of people.
    Include data if appropriate. Particularly for academic grants,
    this examination may take the form of a short literature review
    clarifying that you\’ve read extensively on this topic and
    understand your project\’s scholarly context and significance.
    But even for academic grants it\’s important to clarify why this
    project will make a wider, positive impact and not just how it
    will answer a specific academic question.\n\n\n


    <b>Description of
        Your Project</b>
    (a.k.a. \”project
    narrative\”; \”project
    goals, objectives,
    and methodology\”;
    or \”strategies and
    tactics\”): \n\n\n
    Now that you\’ve established a need for your project, you have
    to describe your project. Make sure you answer these questions:\n\n
    • What are the goals of your project or your research
    questions\?\n
    • What are the goals of your project\?\n
    • What will your project\’s outcomes be\?\n
    [As with many other kinds of outcomes, grant proposal
    outcomes should be SMART—specific, measurable,
    achievable, realistic, and timely.]\n
    • How are you going to achieve those outcomes\? What
    methods will you use\?\n
    • How will you measure or recognize your project\’s
    achievements\?\n
    • How can you be sure that your project will productively
    respond to the need or problem you have identified\?\n
    • What will the timeline for your project be\?\n
\n
    Several of these questions focus on the impact your project
    will have. Delineating the impact is important because funders
    want to see that you\’ve clearly established the realistic
    benefits of your work along with how you plan to verify and
    assess your achievements.\n\n\n


    <b>Budget</b>
    (a.k.a. \”resources\”):\n\n
    Since you are asking for funding or other support, you need to
    clarify just what you\’re asking for and why you are asking for
    particular amounts. Budgets are often formatted in tables and
    figures. Each amount should be clearly labeled, and you might
    need to directly follow your budget with a justification
    statement explaining why each cost, material, and equipment
    is valid, reasonable, and important for your project.\n\n\n


    <b><i>Other Sections
    Sometimes
    Required</i></b>:\n
    \n
    <i>Cover Letter</i>\n
    Sometimes grant proposals are preceded by a cover letter.
    These often serve to personally introduce you as the grant–
    seeking individual/organization, establish your ethos and
    professionalism, briefly describe your proposed project, and
    convey enthusiasm for the project and appreciation for the
    readers\’ consideration
    of your request.\n\n

    <b><i>Organizational Qualifications</i></b>\n
    When you are representing a nonprofit organization,
    sometimes you need to devote a full section to describing the
    nature, mission, and function of your organization. Often this
    comes near the section where you examine a problem.\n\n

    <b><i>Supporting Documents</i></b>\n
    You may need to provide a range of supporting materials at
    the end of your proposal—usually in the form of appendices.
    These might consist of additional records, endorsements, tax
    status information, personnel bios for your organization\’s
    employees, letters of support from allied organizations or
    groups partnering with you in your project, etc. All of this
    documentation should be clearly related to your proposal and
    may be requested by the granting institution.\n\n\n





    <b><i>General Tips</i></b>\n\n
    Pay attention to the agency\’s key interests.\n
    As mentioned earlier, if there are keywords in the call for proposals—or in the funding organization\’s mission or goal—be sure to use some of those terms throughout your proposal. But don\’t be too heavy–handed. You want to help your readers understand the connections that exist between your project and their purpose without belaboring these connections.
\n\n
    <i>Organize ideas through numbered lists.</i>\n
    Some grant writers use numbered lists to organize their ideas within their proposal. They set up these lists with phrases like, \”This project\’s three main goals are . . . \” or, \”This plan will involve four stages . . . \” Using numbers in this way may not be eloquent, but it can an efficient way to present your information in a clear and skimmable manner.
\n\n
    <i>Write carefully customized proposals.</i>\n
    Because grant funding is so competitive, you will likely be applying for several different grants from multiple funding agencies. But if you do this, make sure that you carefully design each proposal to respond to the different interests, expectations, and guidelines of each source. While you might scavenge parts of one proposal for another, never use the exact same proposal twice. Additionally when you apply to more than one source at the same time, be sure to think strategically about the kind of support you are asking from which organization. Do your research to find out, for example, which source is more likely to support a request for materials and which is more interested in covering the cost of personnel.
\n\n
    <i>Go after grants of all sizes.</i>\n
    Pay attention to small grant opportunities as well as big grant opportunities. In fact, sometimes securing a smaller grant can make your appeal for a larger grant more attractive. Showing that one or two stakeholders have already supported your project can bolster your credibility.
\n\n
    <i>Don\’t give up! Keep on writing!</i>\n
    Writing a grant proposal is hard work. It requires you to closely analyze your vision and consider critically how your solution will effectively respond to a gap, problem, or deficiency. And often, even for seasoned grant writers, this process ends with rejection. But while grant writers don\’t receive many of the grants they apply to, they find the process of carefully delineating and justifying their objectives and methods to be productive. Writing closely about your project helps you think about and assess it regardless of what the grant committee decides. And of course, if you do receive a grant, the writing won\’t be over. Many grants require progress reports and updates, so be prepared to keep on writing!
\n\n
    <i>Successful Sample Grant Proposals</i>\n
    One of the best ways to learn how to write grant proposals is to analyze successful samples. We\’ve annotated and uploaded three very different kinds of successful proposals written by colleagues associated with UW–Madison. We encourage you to carefully read these samples along with the annotations we\’ve provided that direct your attention to specific ways each one is doing the work of a strong proposal. But don\’t stop with these! Find additional samples on your own of successful proposals like the one you\’re writing to help guide and further your understanding of what has worked and been persuasive.\n\n\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB27"><b>What is online education\?</b>\n\n\n
    In the last 20 years, the Internet has grown from being nearly non-existent into the largest, most accessible database of information ever created. It has changed the way people communicate, shop, socialise, do business and think about knowledge and learning. Much more than just a new twist on distance learning, online schooling is changing the face of traditional classrooms and making education more accessible than ever before.
    \n\n
    Online education is a form of education where students use their home computers through the internet. For many nontraditional students, among them all those who want to continue working full time or raising families, online graduations and courses have become popular in the past decade. Often online graduation and course programmes, some of which are conducted using digital technologies, are provided via the online learning portal of the host university.\n\n
\n\n
    <b><i>What is online education\?</i></b>\n
    Computer-based training, Web-based training, Internet based training, online training, e-learning (electronic learning), m-learning (mobile learning), computer-aided distance education - online education goes by many names and comes in a variety of styles, but at its core:
\n\n
    \”Online education is electronically supported learning that relies on the Internet for teacher/student interaction and the distribution of class materials.\”
\n\n
    From this simple definition comes an almost infinite number of ways to teach and learn outside of traditional classrooms and away from college campuses. With online education, students can turn anywhere with Internet access and electricity into a classroom. It can include audio, video, text, animations, virtual training environments and live chats with professors. It\’s a rich learning environment with much more ﬂexibility than a traditional classroom.\n\n
    When used to its full potential, online education has been shown to be more effective than pure face-to-face instruction. It can be engaging, fun and tailored to fit almost anyone\’s schedule.
    \n\n
\n
\n
    <b>Online Education Programs</b>\n
    <i>100% Online Education</i> - Fully-online degrees are earned from the comfort of your own home with no required visits to your college or university campus.
    <i>Hybrid Education</i> - Hybrid education allows students to pursue a combination of online and on-campus courses.
    <i>Online Courses</i> - While online courses may be part of a degree program, they can also be taken on their own in order to master a certain subject or learn a specific skill.
    <i>MOOCs</i> - MOOCs, or massive open online courses, are usually delivered in lecture form to online \”classrooms\” with as many as 10,000 people.\n\n\n

    It\’s not easier studying online! Online institutions must meet with the same quality requirements as brick-and-mortar institutions. With the advancement of online learning technologies, virtual institutions have enhanced automated processes to deter fraud and/or plagiarism.
\n\n
    Many online institutions will partner with universities on campus to develop and deliver online programs.
        This enables an online service, while providing validated course studies through the brick-and-mortar institution, to benefit from the advanced expertise
        and technology that an online provider provides.\n\n\n</string>
    <string name="SA_stringTB28"><b>How YouTube works</b>\n\n\n
    YouTube began in early 2005 and has grown rapidly. Every minute, people around the world upload more than 300 hours worth of video footage to YouTube.
\n\n
    YouTube has the second-largest search engine in the world, behind Google (which owns YouTube). This means people are constantly searching for information using YouTube and discovering videos relating to these topics.
\n\n
    <b>YouTube videos</b>\n
    YouTube provides a simple way for people to store videos online and share them with others. YouTube videos cover any topic anyone cares to upload a video about. These videos are easy to share via other forms of social media, email and websites and can also be embedded in other websites.\n\n

    Beside every video on YouTube is a list of \’suggested videos\’ – videos that YouTube\’s search engine calculates are likely to interest people who watch the video you are watching.\n\n

    YouTube encourages viewers to express their opinion of videos they watch, to store videos to watch later and to share videos they like. You can make a video publicly available to anyone, or share it privately with selected people.
\n\n
    <b>YouTube Analytics</b>\n
    YouTube Analytics is a self-service analytics and reporting tool. It provides data about each video you upload, so you can easily track how many views it gets, where people are coming from to find it and what type of people are watching it.
\n\n
    <b><i>YouTube Analytics can give you information about:</i></b>\n
\n
    The \’firsts\’ for the video, including the first referral from a related video, first referral from a YouTube search (including the search terms used), first time the video is embedded in another website
    \n\n\n
    <b>how many views came from each referral source</b>\n
    <b>which gender and age groups the video is most popular with</b>\n
    <b>which countries the video is most popular in</b>\n
    <b>how many comments and ratings it has received.</b>\n\n
    As an example, the YouTube Analytics for the Queensland Government\’s video on \’Crab rules in Queensland\’ on its fisheriesqld YouTube channel shows that it is most popular with males aged 55-64 in Australia. It also shows that 52.5% of views for embedded videos have come via the website of a commercial crab pot manufacturer that embedded the video in its site.
\n\n
    <b>YouTube channels</b>\n
    You can set up a YouTube channel for your business, bringing all your videos together. This allows you to customise your channel with images representing your firm. Your channel includes an \’About\’ section where you can provide a short description of your business and a link to your website or contact details.
\n\n
    Your channel is where you group the videos you make and upload, the videos you watch and like, and the playlists of videos you create.
\n\n
    Your channel will have a web address (URL) that you can promote on your website or marketing material. People can subscribe to your channel. This means when they log in to YouTube your videos will be listed on their YouTube home page.
\n\n
    You can also create \’playlists\’ within your YouTube channel to organise your videos by subject or type. For example, you could have a playlist featuring videos about each of your product categories, or you might have a playlist for videos contributed by your customers for a video competition you run.
\n\n
    <b>YouTube advertising</b>\n
    YouTube incorporates features that let businesses promote their videos to people who might be interested in them, targeting customers by demographics, topics or interests.
\n\n
    Advertisers pay each time someone views their video. You can choose which locations your ad will appear in, what format it will be, and even how much you are prepared to pay per view (if you want to boost the prominence of your ad over your competitors). YouTube\’s advertising guide explains how it works.
\n\n
    <b>Other video sharing services</b>\n
    Other examples of video sharing services include:
\n\n
    <b><i>Vimeo</i></b> – a video website popular with more serious video producers interested in higher quality video production\n
    <b><i>Facebook</i></b> video – the most popular social media site, Facebook, allows users to upload, create and send videos as well as photos and text\n
    <b><i>Flickr</i></b> – primarily a photo sharing site, but can share videos up to 90 seconds as well.\n\n\n</string>
    <string name="SA_stringTB29"><b>Important Steps when Building a new Team</b>\n\n\n

    This article outlines essential steps in forming a new team. These steps are also useful for existing teams that are interested in assessing their format and effectiveness.
\n\n
    First, the work of the team needs to be clearly defined and matched to some real needs of the department, lab or center or of the Institute as a whole. If the team doesn\’t get a clear mission or scope statement from the team sponsor, creating these should be part of the team\’s kick-off process. (See our Checklist for Team Start-up Microsoft Word tool.)
\n\n
    In the early stages it is important to talk to the team\’s sponsor about their role and how they will support the team\’s work. What will the sponsor do for the team\? What does the sponsor expect from the team\? Teams need the clear support of the organization\’s leadership, including concrete support such as release time, funding and resources.
\n\n
    Selecting the right team members is critical. Ideally, teams should be small (not more than ten people) so that members can develop a high-level of connection and interdependence. Members need both technical expertise (including writing and presentation skills) and good interpersonal skills for working in small groups. For teams working on Institute-wide projects, diverse membership (across MIT\’s units, across payroll/employee classifications and across gender/race categories) can lead to a richer team with better results. Content experts, process experts and end users can all play key roles.
\n\n
    Team kick-off events are an important part of the start-up process. Kick-off events enable the team to articulate and understand the goals, mission and structure. A well-planned kick-off can increase team productivity and build team momentum. A formalized start-up activity will help the team define its mission, deliverables, roles &amp; responsibilities, and success factors.
\n\n
    <b>How can I build a successful team\?</b>\n
    Six items are crucial to help teams function effectively.
\n\n
    1. Mission\n
    2. Goals\n
    3. Roles and responsibilities\n
    4. Groundrules\n
    5. Decision-making\n
    6. Effective Group Process\n\n
    \n
    <b><u>Stages of team development</u></b>\nJust like individuals, teams go through stages of development. Although there are a number of descriptions of the stages of team development, the most commonly used terms are forming, storming, norming and performing. (Bruce Tuckman, \”Developmental Sequence in Small Groups,\” 1965 Psychological Bulletin, 63, 384-99)
\n\n
    As in human development, team development is not a linear process -- the introduction of new members, a change in the organization\’s climate, or the successful completion of a particular milestone can cause a team to loop back to an earlier stage of team development.
\n\n
    Recognizing the team\’s development stage can be really helpful as you work to improve your team\’s effectiveness and meet your goals. Each stage has recognizable feelings and behaviors. For more information, see our \”Using the Stages of Team Development\” article and the \”What Stage is Our Team In\?\” tool (Microsoft Word).

        \n
    Samosas, kachoris, choley-bhaturey/kulchey... No matter how much we relish our traditional unhealthy savouries, there is the nagging need to eat nutritious food. To cater to this growing awareness of eating healthy is MitaliKalra\’s year-old Mediterranean cafe, Crostini, tucked away in a corner of the HauzKhas Village in south Delhi.
\n\n
    The idea of starting her own cafe took root in 2010. After completing her MBA in finance from INSEAD in France, in 2008, she spent a year working in Dubai and Singapore, handling private equity investments in oil and gas, and shipping. About a year on, her craving for healthy fare spawned a business idea: a chain of health food cafes in India. So, in December 2011, she left her cushy investment banking job, pumped in Rs 14 lakh from her personal savings, and registered her company name as Zao Foods Private Limited.
\n\n
    A year into operations, her turnover is Rs 25-30 lakh. Till date, she has invested Rs 30 lakh, but expects to earn Rs 35-40 lakh by end of 2013.

    When Anirban Haldar and Rajesh, teamed up to launch Threesixtyone Degrees in 2006, little did they know that they were heading for a bad recession. However, the design company not only survived the downturn, but has emerged stronger—the company\’s revenue for 2013-14 is Rs 60 lakh.
\n\n
    The duo, graduates from the National Institute of Fashion Technology (Anirban from Kolkata, Rajesh from Delhi) wanted to be entrepreneurs despite their non-business backgrounds, but since they wanted work experience, both started their careers as assistants to reputed designers.
\n\n
    Before long, their paths crossed at Pantaloons—Rajesh had been working in the men\’s wear department of the lifestyle retail behemoth since 2001, and Haldar joined its ethnic design team in early 2004. Armed with Rs 5 lakh from their savings, and backed by eight embroiderers and designers, the two set up shop at Oshiwara, Mumbai. However, they continued with their day jobs.
\n\n
    By the end of 2007, the duo had managed to pull off a dream launch for their brand \’Ra\’. They unveiled their collection at the Lakme India Fashion Week and it was warmly received by the design fraternity and the press. Then came the recession and the brand was in trouble. That\’s when the duo decided to focus on their other vertical, which had been set up along with the fashion line.

    <string name="SA_stringTB35"><b>Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) – Definition, Characteristics, &amp; Examples</b>\n\n\n

    Every business has a journey. Their endings might be different but starting is always the same i.e. from a small-scale business to a large-scale business. But in many cases, the business might remain small/medium-sized throughout its life-cycle. These types of businesses come under small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
\n\n
    The number of SMEs in the world is way more than large companies and employs many more employees collectively. Each country has its own standards to identify SMEs.
\n\n
    So, let us understand the concept of SMEs.
\n\n
    <b><i>What is SME\?</i></b>\n
    Small and medium enterprises are privately owned businesses whose capital, workforce, and assets fall below a certain level according to the national guidelines.
\n\n
    Local restaurants, grocery stores, garages, etc. that serve a hyperlocal target audience usually fall under the blanket of a small-to-medium-size enterprise as they generate less revenue and operate with less than a certain level of workforce and assets.
\n\n
    <b><i>Legal Definitions Of SME In Different Countries</i></b>\n
    Legal definition and standards for identifying a small business vary from country to country.

    India
    In India, SMEs are identified on the basis of the investment.

    The service sector\’s investment in the equipment should be more than 10 lakh rupees and less than 2 crore rupees.
    In the case of medium enterprises:

    The manufacturing sector\’s investment in plant &amp;machinery should be more than 5 crore rupees and less than 10 crore rupees.

\n
    Now, there SMEs are identified on the basis of two measures instead of three. They are – `total full-time equivalent of paid employees\’ and `total annual turnover\’.
\n\n
    <b><i>Singapore</i></b>\n
    In Singapore, the Ministry of Trade and Industry re-defined the definition of SMEs in 2011.
\n\n
    SMEs are defined as businesses having an annual sales turnover of S$100 million, or that employs not more than 200 workers.
\n\n\n

    <b>Characteristics of SMEs</b>\n
    Irrespective of different definitions of SMEs in different countries, the characteristics of such businesses remain the same. Some of them may be classified as:
\n\n
    <b><i>Limited Investment</i></b>: The capital requirement of an SME is less as it operates on a small scale.\n
    <b><i>Labor-Intensive</i></b>: SMEs usually don\’t require heavy or sophisticated machinery. Hence, it uses more labor-intensive techniques.\n
    <b><i>Less Number of Employees</i></b>: SMEs requires a smaller number of people as compared to large corporations, due to their small scale of operations.\n
    <b><i>Local Area of Operations</i></b>: SMEs operate locally and remain there for longer periods of time (years or maybe decades) which helps it to build a strong relationship with local customers.\n
    <b><i>Management</i></b>: In most cases, a single owner or a small group of individuals handles the management of the business.\n
     Nowadays, SMEs have become the supporting pillar of any economy in the world in many ways. Without them, the economy cannot survive.\n
\n\n
    The importance of SMEs can be highlighted by the following points:\n

    <b><i>Utilization of Local Resources</i></b>\n
    Opening up of small and medium-sized businesses in rural areas or small towns helps in better utilization of resources in that particular area. If a town is rich in iron ore mines, then factories will open up for the effective utilization of that resource.
\n\n
    <b><i>Employment Generation</i></b>\n
    SMEs are the best solution to unemployment in any country. It provides job opportunities for local people. Especially, in developing countries like India, where unemployment has been a major problem, these businesses provide relief.
\n\n
    <b><i>Opportunities to New Entrepreneurs</i></b>\n
    The major role of SMEs in any country is to cultivate new entrepreneurs. Since small businesses are easier to set up and require less capital, it creates a perfect option for young entrepreneurs to test their skills and grow.
\n\n
    <b><i>Development of Local Areas</i></b>\n
    The development of an area largely depends upon the number of businesses it has. Setting up small businesses helps in providing employment to the local population and removing regional imbalances.
\n\n
    <b><i>Improvement Of The Quality of Life</i></b>\n
    SMEs help the locals by providing them jobs. This increases the per capita income of the household which improves their quality of life.
\n\n\n\n
    <b>Advantages of SME</b>\n
    Some of the main advantages of an SME are:\n\n

    <b><i>More Flexible</i></b>\n
    SMEs are more flexible when it comes to adapting to change. This is because they are small in size, runs on a simple business model, and are closer to their customers. This helps SMEs to identify any kind of opportunity that arises in the market before any competitors.
\n\n
    <b><i>Close Relationship with Customers</i></b>\n
    This is one of the greatest perks of SMEs. While large corporations pour a lot of money to connect with their customers, SMEs do it easily.
\n\n
    SMEs operate locally and have a smaller customer base, which makes it possible to maintain close relationships with its customers.
\n\n
    <b><i>Fast Decision-Making</i></b>\n
    In most cases, small and medium-sized businesses are run by an individual or a small group of people. So, decisions are taken fast as compared to large corporations where it takes time to debate and arrive at a decision.
\n\n
    <b><i>Better Communication</i></b>\n
    SMEs usually employs a small group of people. There is no need for a separate department for hiring employees, all the activities are managed by the owner. He/she keeps track of all the employees and communicates with them effectively.
\n\n
    <b><i>Better Control Over Business</i></b>\n
    The owner manages all the operations of the business effectively as it is small in size. This leads to better control over the business.
\n\n\n
    <b>Disadvantages of SME</b>\n
    Everything has its pro and cons and SMEs are no different. So, let us look at some of the disadvantages of SMEs.
\n\n
    <b><i>Less Use of Technologies</i></b>\n
    Due to less capital, SMEs rely heavily upon labor-intensive techniques instead of capital-intensive techniques. Another reason is that small businesses run on a traditional business model that requires less use of modern technologies.
\n\n
    <b><i>Difficulty In Funding</i></b>\n
    Acquiring funds for an SME is not easy as banks hesitate to hand out loans. This is because a lot of businesses don\’t last long.
\n\
    The owners of SMEs mostly get their funding from family &amp; friends or use their own savings.
\n\n
    <b><i>Less-Skilled Employees</i></b>\n
    Highly skilled employees demand higher pay. So, due to less capital, SMEs settle for less-skilled employees.
\n\n
    <b><i>Risk</i></b>\n
    Risk is always there in running a business, even if the business model is structured to be risk-free, it cannot be eliminated completely.
\n\n
    <b><i>Stress</i></b>\n
    It is not easy to manage all the departments of the business alone. This is why, many times, managing becomes a burden and takes a toll on the mental health of an entrepreneur.
\n\
    In the initial stages of setting up a business, entrepreneurs do extra hours of work ignoring their health which leads to many mental health problems like anxiety and stress.
\n\n\n\n

    <u>Startups vs SMEs</u>\n
    Small and medium-sized businesses are often confused with startups. Many young entrepreneurs call their small business a startup. In businesses, the use of proper terminologies is important to avoid any problems that might arise out of it in the future.
\n\n
    This happens because of a lack of knowledge about the two terms. So, let us understand the key points of difference between the two.
\n
    <b><i>Technology</i></b>: Startups usually use high-end modern technologies while SMEs require less use of technology.\n
    <b><i>Business Model</i></b>: Startups choose an unconventional business model, while SMEs choose a tried and tested business model.\n
    <b><i>Innovation</i></b>: A unique feature of a startup is disruptive innovation. Startups create new offerings or innovate the existing ones, while SMEs deal with existing offerings.\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB40"><b>Top 20 Self Employment Ideas in India which can help you Earn More</b>\n\n\n
   \n


    <b><u>Introduction</u></b>\n\n\n
    In the modern world of the 20th century, with the abundance of career options available to all, many are trying to reject the age-old way of doing jobs. I am talking about the 9-5 work time that has been the standard of the office day for over 100 years now. As the internet has transformed our lives, so has it transformed the way we do business. And thus, it has given rise to many self employment ideas in India for people from all backgrounds based on their skills.
\n
    If you are one of the increasing numbers of people who are looking for business ideas but are unaware of what they are, I have compiled a list of the top 20 self employment ideas in India that you can start, some even from the comfort of your own home, and make money.
\n\n
    <b><i>Why self employment jobs\?</i></b>\n
    Before I begin to list down the top 20 self employment ideas in India, I would like to take you over the benefits of having self employment jobs:
\n\n
    <b><i>Follow your passion</i></b>\n
    Many times people enter work because of the pressure of securing a job. In this, they tend to leave out what they truly wanted to do in life. Pursuing your passion through self-employment jobs allows you to do what you love as well as earn money with it.
\n\n
    <b><i>Be your own boss</i></b>\n
    Having self employment jobs requires you to only report to yourself. You do not have a boss so you work according to yourself
\n\n
    <b><i>Flexible Schedule</i></b>\n
    The biggest complaint of people who commit to a 9-5 job is that they have very restricted time to pursue their hobbies or spend time with their loved ones. This isn\’t the case with self employment jobs. As you have no boss, you can schedule your own work times while giving time to the other important things as well.
\n\n
    <b><i>Help the world</i></b>\n
    The biggest benefit of pursuing self employment opportunities is that you get to provide jobs to other people, thereby helping them build their lives. This good deed goes a long way.
    \n
    \n
    <b><i>Finding the best suit for you</i></b>\n
    \n\n\n\n



   <b><i>Blogging</i></b>\n
    Many people are looking at blogging as stable self employment jobs. As more and more people are connecting to the internet, they are looking for information on a wide variety of topics. These topics range from health and wellness to life hacks. People can even write about what their favorite hairstyle is and how to groom themselves before parties.
\n
    If you are passionate about a particular subject or activity, have enough knowledge or tips about it and have an access to a laptop, you are all set to pen down your thoughts and share with the world. It will be good if you learn a little about Search Engine Optimisation as it will help your blog get listed well in the Google search results, making it easier for more people to come to your website, which will lead to more advertisers willing to pay money .
\n\n
    <b><i>Designing Websites</i></b>\n
    Another set of self employment ideas in India has gained popularity after the boom of the internet is web designing. As more and more brands, and even individuals, are understanding the potential and importance of having a web presence, they are looking for skilled designers who can help them set up their website.
\n
    Though many think these kinds of self employment jobs require high skill sets, this is not true. A lot of online classes and web designing tools are available on the Internet, enough to learn the basics. As you try and create more websites, you learn more things, making these types of self employment opportunities challenging as well as rewarding, both money-wise and skill-wise.
\n\n
    <b><i>Cooking</i></b>\n
    Starting your own home kitchen services is one of the easiest self employment jobs you can pursue, and if you have a passion for cooking, then it is a win-win situation. However, even if you don\’t have a good hand with cooking delicacies, you can hire a cook and begin the work.
\n
    These types of businesses work best if you have an already established consumer base. So if you live in an apartment complex and have a good standing with your neighbors, you can use it to broadcast your services. Thereafter, you can think of expanding to other societies.
\n\n
    <b><i>Delivery Services</i></b>\n
    Beginning a delivery service may seem like a daunting task, but as online marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart have strengthened the e-commerce market, every day there are many smaller companies that are looking for delivery agents to provide their services to the companies. These companies would want you to move products like medicines, home decor, food, etc.
\n\n
    <b><i>Content Writing</i></b>\n
    If you are good with your written words, you can look at this skill to create self employment opportunities for yourself. There are countless online companies that are looking for content writers to write about their company, about their work, or handle their social media content. These companies offer good payment for skilled workers.
\n
    Apart from just content writing, there are also self employment opportunities in the editing market. As there are thousands of books and articles published every month, companies and publishing houses hire proofreaders to go over the grammatical mistakes and correct them.
\n\n
    <b><i>Photography</i></b>\n
    If you have a good eye for photos and understand the nitty-gritty\’s of visual editing through softwares like Adobe Photoshop, you can turn your passion into well paying self employment jobs. As there are countless events that are happening every day in the country, everyone wants to capture the moment in pictures. Thus, you can put yourself to hire for different types of projects like weddings, birthdays, events, or even become a food or travel photographer.
\n
    Another avenue you can pursue these self employment opportunities in photography is by selling your photos online.
\n\n
    <b><i>Freelancing</i></b>\n
    Talking about putting yourself up to hire, another set of self employment ideas in India that can offer you money for your passion is freelancing. Freelancers are people who put their skills online for people to hire them for different tasks. These can include content writing or photography, or even tasks that involve other work from home self employment opportunities.
\n\n
    You can register yourself as a freelancer and look for self employment jobs with the following websites:
\n\n\n
    - PeoplePerHour\n
    - Freelancer.in\n
    - Upwork\n
    - Fiver\n
    - Health Advisor\n\n
    Another type of self employment idea in India that is gaining momentum is in the health and wellness sector. As more and more people are getting conscious of the toxins that are present in packaged foods, they are turning towards experts who can warn them of the harmful effects of such products and provide them with alternatives that can boost their immunity and keep them fit.
\n\n
    <b><i>Online Tutoring</i></b>\n
    The tuition market is always at a record high. However, as more and more parents are setting out to work, they are hiring more tutors to teach their children. So, if you can brush up on the concepts you learned in school, you can use these self employment opportunities to earn well and help children too.
\n
    Apart from this, there are online websites like Udemy that look at experts who can construct courses and sell them online. We at Chegg India also offer self employment jobs with our Subject Experts program which hires freelancers who can provide answers to student problems posted on our website.
\n\n
    <b><i>Digital Marketing</i></b>\n
    As more and more brands are looking at the online space for marketing their products and services, they are offering many self employment opportunities to individuals who can handle their digital marketing activities. Though some think of digital marketing as a skill you can only learn with a college degree there are programs like Google Digital Unlocked that can give you a quick crash course in understanding the activities of digital marketing. Thereafter, you are set to pursue such self employment ideas in India.
\n\n
    <b><i>Write a book</i></b>\n
    Did you know that JK Rowling became a billionaire just by writing the Harry Potter series. Therefore, there is a huge scope in these self employment ideas in India as books are published at a large scale, and once you garner enough interest within your readers, there is no stopping your fame.
\n\n
    <b><i>Sell Used Products</i></b>\n
    India is still home to a lot of users who buy good quality second-hand items as they are cheaper and get the job done for much less money. Thus, these type of self employment ideas in India offers you to tap into this large market and provide these services that the society demands. Websites like OLX and Quikr have already amassed a lot of money using these trends, now it\’s time for you.
\n\n
    <b><i>Become a Stand Up Comic</i></b>\n
    Who said self employment jobs have to be only about starting a business. The stand-up world is full of engineers who quit continuing on the path of a 9-5 job because they found their calling in the laughter business. You can do this too. To pursue these types of self employment ideas in India, you don\’t need to start at a stage, you can even begin by posting videos and YouTube. The more people laugh at your jokes, the more famous you become.
\n\n
    <b><i>Develop Apps</i></b>\n
    As you know that almost everyone in the country has a smartphone. This has led to a boom in the app creation market as everyone is trying to download and use different apps. This can help you secure some jobs from self employment ideas in India as you can enter this world by learning the skill of creating apps. And it is not as tough as you think it is. You can start by creating easy games that only require people to tap. Thereafter, once you have developed your skill, you can head on to make more apps like ordering food, products, medicines, etc.
\n\n
    <b><i>Wedding Planner</i></b>\n
    If you have seen Anushka Sharma and Ranveer Singh\’s \’Band Baaja Baaraat\’, you would be familiar with the dream Anushka\’s character had in the film, about starting her own wedding planning company \’Shaadi Mubarak\’. Though that film was fiction, you can follow the same pathway and begin working on your wedding planning company. Start off with your cousins and your relatives, and let the word spread about your management skills.
\n\n
    <b><i>Launch a Food Truck</i></b>\n
    If you have cooks within your family who can create dishes that everyone wants to eat, you can think about starting a food truck business. These self employment ideas in India offer you the flexibility to transfer your food truck to the places that have the most business, like outside colleges and office complexes. As more people hear about your delicious recipes, more orders begin to come.
\n\n
    <b><i>Start a Beauty Parlour</i></b>\n
    People are always worried about how they are looking and often spend thousands of rupees at fancy parlors. You can tap into this desire and create self employment jobs for you and your family by starting a parlor within your own house. You can begin with the people around your house, and expect it to grow larger as the word spreads out.
\n\n
    <b><i>Become an Interior Designer</i></b>\n
    If you are good with designing spaces like living rooms and bedrooms you can look at interior designing as one of the most rewarding self employment ideas in India out there. You can begin small, but as you get more clients, you can hire your own team of real estate agents, contractors, etc. who can work under you for bringing to life your ideas of interior designs.
\n\n
   <b><i>Become a Life Coach</i></b>\n
    If you have achieved a successful career, or have the wisdom to give out to people about certain lifestyle choices, you can become a life coach. Life Coaches are nothing but people who guide others to achieve success and a peaceful mind. They can talk about different topics like managing time, effort, passion, and will to succeed. One of the skills for these self employment jobs is public speaking as it helps greatly in imparting your message the correct way.
\n\n
    <b><i>Daycare for Pets</i></b>\n
    You can create self employment jobs by renting your house and converting a section into a pet daycare. As there are many owners who have to leave their dogs alone at home when they leave for work, they can instead drop them by your house. For these self employment ideas in India, I would suggest you start out small, like only taking one type of animal at a time. You have to do a lot of tasks, including feeding them, bathing them, taking care of their needs, while keeping them happy. But, once you start getting more customers, you can spread and accept different types of pets too.

Tomato is a rich source of vitamins A, C, potassium, minerals, and fibers. Tomatoes are used in the preparation of soup, salad, pickles, ketchup, puree, sauces and are also consumed as a vegetable in many other ways. As the raw material is available throughout the country, a small-scale tomato processing unit is a profitable venture in India.

    <string name="SA_stringTB45"><b>Home Business Ideas: 8 Ways to Start a Work-From-Home Business</b>\n\n\n\n



    When you think of owning and operating a business, you might think about renting commercial real estate, commuting to an office, or managing employees.
\n\n
    But with the rise of home businesses, more and more people are discovering ways to use remote work to pursue entrepreneurship with their headquarters at home.
\n\n
    In today\’s connected world where technology affords us more flexibility in how and where we work, home-based businesses come in a wide variety of forms.
\n\n
    Some require you to convert a spare room into a mini-warehouse for products, while others can be run completely online. But generally, you can start these types of businesses using your existing space and means.
\n\n
    \n
    \n
    <i><u>What makes a \”home-based\” business: The pros and cons</u></i>\n\n


    A home-based business is a venture—whether full-time or run as a side hustle—that you can start and operate using your own home as your base of operations. A few home-based businesses, especially those that sell online and don\’t buy and hold lots of inventory, can even be run on the go—you don\’t necessarily need to be bound to your home.
\n\n
    Naturally, there are pros and cons to consider when deciding whether a home-based business is right for you.
\n\n
    <i>Pros:</i>\n
    A low investment business idea has fewer overhead costs (such as warehousing fees), plus potential tax deductions you can claim.\n
    The option to sell products or services locally or internationally.\n
    Flexible work/life balance, which is ideal if you\’re a stay-at-home parent or a retiree, for example.\n
    You can create a family business where your relations or your spouse can chip in as needed.\n\n


    <i>Cons:</i>\n
    You may need to convert space in your home to support the needs of your home business (e.g. holding inventory, creating a home office, or storing equipment). The challenge can be doing it without disrupting your life at home.\n
    You still have to comply with any regulations that pertain to the business you want to start (e.g. you may still need to rent a commercial kitchen if you plan to sell food products or a license/permit to hold inventory).\n
    Your business may outgrow your home and require you to rent additional space and hire employees.\n
    Working from home offers you a lot of freedom, but it can also be lonely. This might be difficult if you enjoy being around other people.\n\n\n
\n


    <b><i>8 home-based business ideas you can start today</i></b>\n\n\n
    While there are plenty of ways to go about starting a home-based business, the following are some of the most approachable paths to creating a home business for yourself:
\n\n
    <u>Buy products in bulk to sell</u>\n
    <u>Sell homemade products you make yourself</u>\n
    <u>Start a dropshipping store</u>\n
    <u>Start a print-on-demand store</u>\n
    <u>Sell your service or expertise</u>\n
    <u>Productize your service or expertise</u>\n
    <u>Grow an audience you can monetize</u>\n
    <u>Buy an existing ecommerce business</u>\n



    1. <b><i>Buy products in bulk and sell them online</i></b>\n
    Many businesses center on the simple concept of importing products in bulk and selling them individually for a profit.
\n
    Maybe you recently traveled abroad and came across unique products that aren\’t readily available in your market despite an appetite for them. Or maybe you\’ve zeroed in on a niche and know the perfect products to serve its customers.
\n
    Either way, if these products are relatively easy to store and ship, you may have a solid home-based business idea on your hands. Blue light blocking glasses, for example, are small and durable enough to store in your own home.
\n
    Your home can even be used as an initial showroom—which is how Artemis Design Co. got its start—to sell locally, giving you the option to expand with additional storage space and employees as you validate your idea and sales start to ramp up.
\n
    \”I was living in the south end of Boston, and I had my living room just full of these products. I would have people come over if they wanted to look at something or try something on, and that\’s how I made my first sale.\”
\n
    Milicent Armstrong, Artemis Design Co.

\n\n

    2. <b><i>Sell homemade products</i></b>\n
    If you\’re a maker yourself (or know someone who is), you can also consider turning a hobby into a business. Even if you have to create your products elsewhere—in a studio, commercial kitchen, or workshop—you may be able to store them and sell them in your own home.
\n
    With the ability to control nearly every aspect of the products you sell, you can make them more cost-effective, improve their quality, or cater them to a certain audience to target demand in the market.
\n
    Whether you choose to start on a marketplace like Etsy or want to build your own branded storefront, selling your creations is a great way to share your passion with others and make money too. Just be wary of regulations concerning products that customers ingest or put on their skin.
\n\n
    Examples of handmade products you can sell include:
\n
    <u>Candles</u>\n
    <u>Jewelry</u>\n
    <u>Cosmetics</u>\n
    <u>Art</u>\n
    <u>Food</u>\n
    <u>Apparel</u>\n\n


    Best of all, producing your own products doesn\’t have to be overwhelming. When you\’re ready to scale, you can establish a process and onboard new employees to help with production.
\n\n
    3. <b><i>Start a dropshipping store</i></b>\n
    So far, we\’ve covered business ideas that require you to hold inventory in your home. But there are a variety of ideas to pursue that allow you to take inventory and shipping off your hands.
\n
    These businesses employ a dropshipping model, where a third party produces, stores, and ships your products on your behalf, leaving marketing and customer service as your chief responsibilities.
\n
    Your dropshipping supplier can be local or overseas, but you need to ensure you find a supplier you can trust to deliver a consistently great customer experience after the sale. Always do your due diligence or you might put your business\’s reputation at risk.
\n
    There are even Shopify apps, such as Oberlo, that can connect you with suppliers to import products into your own store while streamlining order fulfillment.
\n
    At its core, dropshipping involves becoming a distributor of a third party\’s products, taking on the costs of marketing (time and money) to be rewarded with the margins when you make a sale. This can make your products a commodity in many cases with limited opportunities to brand your customer experience. Luckily, there are a few different ways you can still compete even when there\’s no shortage of your products in the market you\’re selling in:
\n
    \nCurate products, from different suppliers, to create a store that serves a specific niche.
    \nCompete through quality content and customer service that creates value beyond your products.
    \nTarget an underserved region of the world (be sure to pay attention to your shipping costs).
    \nTarget a new audience with the same products (e.g. LED shoes can be marketed to music festival goers or runners).
    \nIf you\’re interested in learning more about starting a dropshipping business, be sure to check out The Ultimate Guide to Dropshipping.
\n\n
    4. <b><i>Start a print-on-demand business</i></b>\n
    Using a similar dropshipping model, a print-on-demand business doesn\’t require you to hold any inventory or ship it yourself either. Print-on-demand even offers you more flexibility to customize white label products with your own creative designs.
\n
    And there are a wide range of products you can sell: books, t-shirts, hats, backpacks, blankets, pillows, mugs, shoes, hoodies, phone cases, watches, and more depending on the supplier you choose to work with.
\n
    Many print-on-demand businesses focus on serving a specific niche or, better yet, a shared identity. What are people passionate about and proud to share\? What about yourself\? From pet owners to vegans to gamers, there are plenty of passionate communities you can create products for.
\n
    If you have design skills, then you can create your own designs. But if not, you can always hire the talent you need.
\n\n

    5. <b><i>Sell your service or expertise</i></b>\n
    Services are even simpler than products to start selling at home, but the challenge is allocating your limited time. \”Time is money\” is never truer than when you\’re running a service-based business.
\n
    Creative professionals, like designers or marketers, might freelance or consult with other companies, juggling multiple clients, often remotely from their own home office with the occasional travel. Others might operate based on appointments and bookings to offer their services to individuals directly.
\n
    Service-based home business ideas include:
\n
    <u>Tutoring</u>\n
    <u>House cleaning</u>\n
    <u>Freelance writing</u>\n
    <u>Personal training</u>\n
    <u>Virtual assistance</u>\n
    <u>Dog-walking</u>\n
    <u>Marketing</u>\n
    <u>Designing</u>\n\n


    Service-based businesses often require a lot of networking and word of mouth referrals to find suitable clients, but satisfied clients will likely retain your services over time and continue to give you their business.
\n\n
    For this reason, you don\’t necessarily need a large number of customers to do well, as you would with a product-based business. Depending on the service you\’re offering, a handful of high-quality clients can be enough to support yourself full-time while working from home.

    6. <b><i>Productize your service or expertise</i></b>\n
    As we just discussed, one of the biggest downsides of running a service-based business is that you are being paid strictly for your time, skills, and effort.
\n
    \”Productizing\” your service—creating digital or physical products that package up your expertise, and streamline or complement the service you offer—can add additional revenue streams to your business. You can cater to your current customer base or even find a new target customer in the same space.
\n\n
    Some ideas for adding products to your service-based business include:
\b
    <u>Courses</u>\n
    <u>Designs</u>\n
    <u>Licensable assets (stock footage, music, etc.)</u>\n
    <u>Downloadable reports</u>\n
    <u>Digital templates</u>\n
    <u>Merchandise</u>\n
    <u>eBooks</u>\n\n


    As you can see, most of these ideas involve digital media packaged as products, which means no inventory to keep around the house. If you\’re running your home business on Shopify, you can sell digital products seamlessly using the Digital Downloads or SendOwl app.
\n\n


    7. <b><i>Grow an audience you can monetize</i></b>\n
    If you\’re a content creator, have a sizable online audience already, or have always thought about starting your own blog, YouTube channel, Instagram account, or podcast, then you can potentially grow and then monetize your following using any of the previous ideas on this list.
\n
    On top of that, you can also explore becoming an affiliate—selling other products or services for a commission—or accepting payment for sponsored posts to give brands a chance to connect with your audience.
\n
    Building a loyal audience requires patience, consistency, and focus. This is not the easiest way to start a home-based business, especially not in the short-term, but if you\’re able to build a following around something you love it can be one of the most fulfilling and enduring, giving you the flexibility to pursue multiple revenue streams at once.
\n
    The potential to monetize your audience often depends on the niche you choose to serve. If you\’re starting from scratch or are in the midst of growing your own audience, be sure to check out the following guides to learn how to best grow and monetize the most popular channels:

    8. <b><i>Buy an existing ecommerce business</i></b>\n
    Last but not least, if you\’re more interested in simply investing in a source of income that you can maintain while at home or on the go, then you can consider buying an established ecommerce business.
\n
    Prices can vary greatly based on a variety of factors, from total revenue generated, profit potential, available assets (like an email list or social following), inventory, and more. Some sellers will even onboard you and teach you the ropes of running their store.
\n
    Exchange is a marketplace powered by Shopify for buying and selling ecommerce stores. You can browse the listings for businesses that are suit your budget, level of experience, and needs. Maybe you want to buy a proven business and are willing to invest more money to acquire it. Or perhaps one catches your eye with untapped potential that you\’d like to grow.
\n
    Just be sure to vet each listing and consider everything that\’s included in the sale. Revenue and other data can be verified through Shopify so you can rest assured that those numbers are accurate.

    <u><i>Find a home business idea that works for you</i></u>\n

    <string name="SA_stringTB46"><b>50 Passive Income Ideas for Financial Freedom</b>\n\n\nPicture yourself sitting in your favourite chair watching your favourite series in the middle of the day. You\’ve had your green tea lesson with your Japanese tea master and soon it will be time for kettlebells on the lawn... oh, and all this time you are earning money. That is pretty much the idea of Passive Income Streams.
\n\n
    How else are you going to take that 3-month mini-retirement in your dream Thailand yoga retreat\? We have prepared more than 50 possible ideas for passive income to get your imagination flowing and your entrepreneurial juices flowing! Here goes…

\n1. <b><i>REAL ESTATE OWNERSHIP</i></b>\n
    One of the oldest ways to get a passive income is through owning property, such as an apartment, a house or similar. It is completely passive and only involves regular cleaning and maintenance activities during the year which, in most cases, you won\’t do yourself. The money comes from renting the property on a weekly, monthly or daily basis in the case of serviced apartments. This freedom is the reason why many people decide to get into property investment. If you are willing to try any type of investment in real estate, read these tips for beginners.
\n\n
    2. <b><i>CROWD-FUNDED REAL ESTATE</i></b>\n
    When you want to invest in property but lack an amount of capital perhaps crowd-funded real estate is a good solution. If you don\’t own any property, you can apply through many crowd-funding platforms and get your investment into some property. Check Realty Shares or Property Moose to get more info.
\n\n
    3. <b><i>USE AIRBNB OR HOMEAWAY TO RENT A ROOM OR YOUR HOUSE</i></b>\n
    Using your free space in your house or apartment and making it rentable can bring you secure money each month. That is possible through Airbnb and all you have to do is set up your space and become an Airbnb host. You can do the same for your entire home if desired. Both Airbnb and HomeAway.com offer this possibility.
\n\n
    4. <b><i>LET SOMEONE CAMP ON YOUR LAND</i></b>\n
    Do you live in a picturesque area\? Perhaps somewhere popular with tourists. Did you know you can rent a spot in your garden for a tourist to pitch their tent and sleep for the night\?
\n\n
    Well, you can! Camp in My Garden is one such platform you can sign up to.
\n\n
    5. <b><i>RENT OUT STORAGE SPACE</i></b>\n
    If you own any big property that you don\’t use, you can make it huge storage and rent it out for any number of storage purposes. Indeed sometimes people invest in big spaces for this very purpose and after some time they become their passive income. For a clearer understanding, read why storage units are considered one of the best income streams.
\n\n
    6. <b><i>GET DIVIDENDS FROM INVESTMENT</i></b>\n
    Buying shares and investing in stock can make you earn enough money by just receiving the dividends from the investments. It has its risks and takes a lot of investigation at the beginning and, of course, a certain sum of money, but it can pay off in the future. Some websites, like StockBrokers, offer quality and quantity reviews for the stock market and they might be a good start.
\n\n
    7. <b><i>PEER-TO-PEER LENDING INVESTMENT</i></b>\n
    Lending is a good way to increase the amount of money you have and this way will net you bigger rates, without any bank fees. As an investor, you lend money to other people interested to borrow and then receive it in return at a higher interest rate than you could hope to get from the bank. A good start is this blog, which will help you to get into the topic in more detail.
\n\n
    8. <b><i>ANNUITY</i></b>\n
    Monthly or yearly investing in an insurance fund can help you receive a certain amount of money when you retire. You choose the period you want to receive the money and the investment you would give, but people usually decide to receive annuities during their pension years. If you have any doubts, read about the possibilities annuities can bring to you.
\n\n
    9. <b><i>INVEST AS A SILENT PARTNER</i></b>\n
    We all have friends or people we know with great business ideas. If you find those ideas inspiring and sustainable, you can help the owners with an investment as a silent partner and start earning money when they develop their business.
\n\n
    10. <b><i>INVEST WITH ROBO-ADVISORS</i></b>\n
    There is one special type of investment that is fully automatized through programmes called robo-advisors. With robot programs, you can specify your investment wishes and capacities and let the fully automated system search for investment opportunities. Betterment is one such company providing such opportunities. Also, the likes of Wealthfront can help you with developing a good investment strategy and reduce the risks that can occur at the beginning of an investment process.
\n\n
    11. <b><i>REATE SAVINGS</i></b>\nC
    The traditional way of \”collecting\” money in your bank account (or even under your bed if you are old school) is a totally passive process that can lead to creating a fund for use in future investment. Online banks have better opportunities with interest rates for creating such funds, but given previous financial crashes stuffing notes under the mattress starts to look more attractive! If you think you are not very good at saving, look at these 8 tips and start today.
\n\n
    12. <b><i>CASHBACK REWARDS ON CREDIT CARDS</i></b>\n
    We all go shopping every day and the opportunity to get cash back when you buy with a credit card is something really worth doing. Once you have set the cashback rewards they only bring you income when you pay with your cards. And that is all that you need to do. Interested in maximizing cashback rewards\? Check out Forbes\’ advice.
\n\n
    13. <b><i>CASHBACK REWARDS ON CASHBACK SITES</i></b>\n

\n\n
    14. <b><i>SELL ICE CREAM OR BETTER STILL ORGANISE SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT</i></b>\n
    What do you desire more, during summertime, than ice cream\? Be in the right place at the right time and it could increase your earnings a lot, allowing you to spend less time working in the offseason. If you think we are stretching the meaning of passive income here then employ somebody else to do it and take a modest cut. Relly we want to illustrate that opportunism has a part to play in earning passive income. There are always things you can start and farm out to others to actually to the legwork.
\n\n
    15. <b><i>OWN A VENDING MACHINE OR LAUNDROMAT</i></b>\n
    Just as with owning an ice cream stand, having vending machines around the city or laundromats is not so passive unless other people do most of the work for you. However it requires relatively little maintenance and an activity that is not a daily job. Also, it brings extra money and if it develops it can become serious business. Thinking about this business\? Read this article.
\n\n
    16. <b><i>RENT EQUIPMENT YOU OWN</i></b>\n
    If you own any interesting equipment like audio, video equipment or something with a high-value that most regular folks do not own, you can rent it out and do nothing. With a few ads online you can have an income, while people come to you to take the equipment and come back to you to return it. Make a list of all possible stuff you can rent and start today!
\n\n
    17. <b><i>DROP SHIPPING</i></b>\n
    Going to the trouble of creating a website, marketing and selling something that somebody else has produced is not passive work on the face of it, but it can be if you are, for example, working in marketing. It\’s not so hard these days to throw up a website and even an e-commerce site through the likes of squarespace.com. Once the business is set up and running the processes involved can easily be outsourced so drop shipping can transform nicely to passive income. So check all starting points you need to do before you get into it.
\n\n
    18. <b><i>OWN A PARTY SPACE SUCH AS A MARQUEE</i></b>\n
    All your job when your own equipment such as a marquee for parties or celebrations is to transport it to the people who have rented it. They may even come to you and pick it up if you want to make it more passive. The most important thing here is marketing and you can sit on your couch and wait for the money to come, after renting. Do you like the idea\? Read this step-by-step guide and start your own business plan!
\n\n
    19. <b><i>POST A COMMERCIAL ON YOUR CAR</i></b>\n
    Renting your car window and door for an ad is one more way to earn certain amounts of money. You can check Carvertise and see how everything works.
\n\n
    20. <b><i>EARN MONEY THROUGH PLATFORMS BY DOING WHAT YOU USUALLY DO ONLINE</i></b>\n
    If you like watching videos, researching online or some other stuff you do almost every day, then you can earn money very simply – just doing that. Platforms like Inbox dollars and Swagbucks have these possibilities, but before you start us – make sure they are totally legit!
\n\n
    21. <b><i>SCAN A GROCERY RECEIPT AND EARN MONEY</i></b>\n
    We all shop for groceries nearly every day and when we get the receipts, we can earn money through several apps just by scanning them. Click here to learn how to earn from grocery receipts.
\n\n
    22. <b><i>DRIVE FOR UBER AND MAKE MONEY</i></b>\n
    Imagine that you can drive your car to your usual destinations and make money for that just by picking up other people going in the same direction\? That is possible with Uber and it\’s totally passive because you are doing the things you already would do.
\n\n
    23. <b><i>BECOME A REFERRAL SOURCE IN YOUR FIELD</i></b>\n
    If you think you can help someone to sell his services or goods through your business, website or blog you can become a referral source. If you are an influencer in your community, you can help a business grow by referring others to their services and goods. Every referral can bring you a certain amount of money depending on what you agree with the business or person you\’re promoting.
\n\n
    24. <b><i>WRITE AN E-BOOK</i></b>\n
    Of course, it takes time in the beginning to write an e-book. Keep in mind that an e-book can be from just a few pages to hundreds. When you finish publication, depending on the topic, you can receive royalties from selling your book online years after it was published. There are several platforms you can publish and sell your e-books, for example; Fiverr, Amazon, Blurb. Check these sites and find your starting point.
\n\n
    25. <b><i>WRITE A FEW KINDLE BOOKS</i></b>\n
    Fancy yourself as a novelist\? Amazon\’s very powerful publishing platform, Kindle, is a place where you can publish your own books and start earning money from them. Make sure the topic is popular, the content is authentic and note: you don\’t need to be a writer. Kindle is not under the e-book topic because it requires special formatting and conditions, so check them here.
\n\n
    26. <b><i>BUY A WEBSITE OR BLOG</i></b>\n
    Buying already established websites or blogs with specific traffic can give you a good starting point for developing a business. You can either develop business for profit or increase the current traffic and resell it. Flippa is a good place for looking at such websites and domains.
\n\n
    27. <b><i>CREATE A BLOG AND MARKET IT</i></b>\n
    To create a blog and start earning from it requires many skills and knowledge and also the not so passive activity of creating it and making it profitable. Once it is established, however, there are many possible ways to get a passive income rather than active income from it. Posting quality pictures, sharing your content on social media and create the bound relationship with your readers are just a few of many ways that can help your blog be the recognizable and good basis for marketing ideas, such as Google Adsense or Affiliate marketing. A lot of the process can be \”automated\” and outsourced thus getting some way to doing what you want to do an earning that passive income.
\n\n
    28. <b><i>EMAIL MARKETING</i></b>\n
    Another type of online marketing that can get an additional passive income is email marketing. By sending emails for products and informing people to buy you can get additional income. One good example of passive email marketing is just sending affiliate offers through an email network which is even better if you have platforms where you have gathered many subscribers and you got a good email base. You can also put in the hours (or pay someone else to do it) in creating a valuable network of high worth individuals through lead generation or networking through LinkedIn, although of course, it is difficult to be credible in doing the latter.
\n\n
    29. <b><i>NETWORK MARKETING</i></b>\n
    Network marketing includes developing a network of people working for you and selling your products. One of the best examples is the Avon company for this type of marketing. In the beginning, you need to provide all the resources, but after the network itself grows and at the same time it grows your earnings.
\n\n
    30. <b><i>AFFILIATE MARKETING</i></b>\n
    Affiliate marketing is something like a referral. You offer other people\’s products and expect to earn a certain commission from the purchase or sign up. If you are into some topic and have relevant platforms, you can sell products or services from other people and get your own earnings from that or you can create an affiliate platform. If you are new in this, we suggest a beginner\’s start.
\n\n
    31. <b><i>MAKE YOUTUBE VIDEOS OR TUTORIALS</i></b>\n
    Filming a video and posting it online with the many millions of people who can watch it, is something that can genuinely create passive income. Of course, you have to generate enough views, but there are a lot of possibilities to earn money.
\n\n
    32. <b><i>CREATE ONLINE COURSES AND WEBINARS</i></b>\n
    Setting up the right course on the right online platform, and with a popular topic, can make you increase your earnings long-term just with a bit of hard work at the beginning. Every purchase of a course or webinar earns you royalties from it and if you get the topic right you can keep earning from one course for a long period of time. Check Learn Words and Teachable for a good start in the world of selling courses.
\n\n
    33. <b><i>GOOGLE ADSENSE</i></b>\n
    If you own a website, blog or Youtube channel you can add Google Adsense and allow ads to show on your platforms. Depending on the traffic you have this can give you a decent income, although it is fair to say that web users are more and more inured to adverts.
\n\n
    34. <b><i>CREATE COMPARISON, GUIDE SITE OR LIBRARY SITE</i></b>\n
    These kinds of web sites can bring you a lot of traffic over time and help you earn with various online advertising techniques and if the niche and content are good, it doesn\’t necessarily take too much upkeep. We all use comparison sites for example, so this is an ongoing investment with a great chance of remaining active for many years.
\n\n
    35. <b><i>BUILD A STORE FOR YOUR OWN OFFLINE SELLING BUSINESS</i></b>\n
    Do you have you a successful offline business\? Create a store in the online world and start earning money from the same business both online and offline. There are a lot of things that need to be done, like shop website, marketing, before you start operating but it is relatively simple these days with the likes of Shopify.
\n\n
    36. <b><i>CREATE AN APP FOR ANDROID OR IOS OR USE MONEY MAKING APPS</i></b>\n

\n\n
    37. <b><i>BUY AN EXISTING ONLINE BUSINESS</i></b>\n
    Similar to domains, people buy already established online businesses and take the revenue or make them earn even more. Usually, they receive immediate passive income if it is developed. On BusinessesForSale.com you can find various types of businesses that are waiting for people to buy them.
\n\n
    38. <b><i>OUTSOURCE YOUR ACTIVE BUSINESS ONLINE</i></b>\n
    By getting someone else to effectively run your business for you, you can create passive income.

\n\n
    39. <b><i>BUY AND SELL DOMAINS AND USERNAMES</i></b>\n
    When the Internet started domains that were created with the most basic keywords can now be worth thousands of dollars (maybe more). The same is true for usernames on social media platforms.

    <string name="SA_stringTB52"><b>12 Steps to Start a Small Business in India in 2022\?</b>
    \n\n\n

    The world\’s corporate giants were not born overnight. Somebody somewhere had an idea, developed a plan, collected funds, and started a business. Dedication, uniqueness, and an excellent service nurtured it.
\n
    Quality and branding preserve it. A read into the history of any significant corporation consistently enforces this precept. The same mandate holds good for India\’s industrial giants.
\n
    <u><b>\"Make In India\"</b></u>\n
    \’Make In India,\’ a pioneering program in the history of the world\’s largest democracy, was flagged off on 25/09/2014 by PM Narendra Modi.
\n
    The \’Make In India\’ initiative is three-pronged.
\n\n
    It motivates manufacturers and service providers in India to upscale quality to meet and exceed global standards. \’Make In India\’ also inspires entrepreneurship among Indians through incentives and offerings for establishing micro, small and medium ventures.
\n\n\n
    <b>How to Start a Small Business in 2022</b>\n\n
    Here is the 12 step plan to start any small business idea in India. After reading this, I am sure you will make a solid blueprint and start your small-scale business from home.
\n\n
    1. <b><i>Decide on a business idea</i></b>\n
    You must have a unique business idea. A large number of lucrative business ideas are available on the MSME and Make In India websites.\n
    India has opened doors to many sectors for small businesses, including aerospace and defence, for MSME. Many opportunities are available in hospitality, tourism, manufacturing industries, and agriculture under \’Make In India.\’
\n
    Indian citizens, Non-Resident Indians can launch any small businesses, Overseas Citizens of India/ Person of Indian Origin and foreign nationals in partnership with locals. India\’s Foreign Exchange governs investments by foreign companies and nationals, and Monetary Act (FEMA) is subject to Reserve Bank of India regulations.
\n\n
    2. <b><i>Get more training, experience</i></b>\n
    You must start your business according to your expertise. Remember, your skills and experience will decide the success of your business. Try to learn as many tricks of the trade as possible and implement in your business
\n
    You may opt for a specialized or vocational training course offered by various famous institutes of the Indian government. You can also get additional skills by working with other established organizations in the field. It is always best to start as a beginner, forgetting all past knowledge and experience.
\n\n
    It will help you to learn more with fresher perspectives. Certain banks and licensing authorities might also require technical education certifications for validating your business.
\n\n
    3. <b><i>Writing it down: The Project Report</i></b>\n
    Uniqueness decides the success of any business. It would help if you studied domestic and international markets for products, services compatible with yours. Find all the detail related to your business. Read more and more stories on the success and failure of similar businesses.
\n
    The 1st step to any business begins with feasibility studies and a project report. This can be achieved with the help of experts, based on the nature of business and funds.
\n
    A project report must contain details, including the owner or partners\’ name, age, and qualification. Attach experience certificates relevant to the trade. This helps in getting the finance.
\n
    Include a revenue model with more specific details, including cost and sale price, delivery charges, taxes, and other expenses. Project expected revenues for the next 2-3 years.
\n\n
    4. <b><i>Finalize your source of funds</i></b>\n
    Most small businesses in India are self-funded or launched by collecting funds from family and friends. You will require a fair estimate of how much money you will require to launch your stratup.
\n
    Also, calculate the finances you will need to keep the business afloat till it becomes profitable. Entrepreneurs launching micro, small and medium enterprises can seek funding from various places explained below
\n\n
    <u>Banks</u>: You need to check with various nationalized or private banks for startup capital offers.
\n
    <u>Cooperative credit societies</u>: Most credit societies offer loans for small businesses and home businesses if you purchase their shares.
\n
    <u>Community development funds</u>: Focused on the welfare of specific communities, they offer finance for small businesses.
\n
    <u>Crowdfunding</u>: Attracting investment from friends, neighbors, community, or the general public in exchange for company stock.
\n
    <u>Venture capitalists/angel investors</u>: These have exploded in India over the last 5 years and offer great funding opportunities for small businesses, startups, and home businesses.
\n
    \t<i>Lending rates and other details are prone to vary depending on the type of venture, projected ROI, risk factors, and others.</i>
\n\n
    5. <b><i>Decide on your location</i></b>\n
    If you are starting a business in India, you need space at home or a shop, stall, workshop, or office. Registering your small business with the local municipality/ village administration is mandatory under Indian laws.
\n
    The civic body or gram panchayat will permit your small/home business from the area under its jurisdiction. Utility providers ask for municipal/ village panchayat registration before giving electricity and water connections to the premises.
\n
    Your location serves as proof of the physical address of your business. Taxes levied on businesses in rural areas are lower.
\n\n
    6. <b><i>Business registration and legalization</i></b>\n
    This is a messy, daunting job for every business person. Registering your business in India can be lengthy and complicated. Thanks to direct instructions from PM Narendra Modi, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) now registers new companies within one or two working day.
\n
    Almost all formalities for registering a business can be completed on the internet. Details about documentation required and other FAQs are listed on the MCA website. Licenses from various state and central govt are mandatory when launching a small business or startup.
\n\n
    7. <b><i>Get yourself tax registered</i></b>\n
    Starting a small business at home entails procuring a Permanent Account Number (PAN) and Taxpayers Identification Number (TIN). Getting a PAN and TIN is relatively easy.
\n
    You can approach any PAN and TIN service center authorized by NSDL (National Securities Depository Ltd), submit completed forms by attaching required documents, and pay a nominal fee. PAN and TIN numbers are allotted within 30 working days from the date of application.
\n
    PAN and TIN are helpful when paying taxes to the government year after year.
\n\n
    8. <b><i>Launch your own website</i></b>\n
    Based upon their nature, all small businesses in India can be categorised in three types:
\n
    - <i>Online</i> (it can be a home business or set up an office)
    - <i>Online and physical</i>\n
    - <i>Physical</i> (store/ office/ workshop/home)\n\n


    Trends demand every business to maintain an online presence. This can be done by creating a website or social media pages like Facebook Page, Instagram page, depending on budget and product/ services offered.
\n\n
    Creating an E-commerce store is ideal since they allow direct ordering and multiple payment choices. Today especially after covid-19 require an online presence even for purely physical businesses to match rivals and reach a wider clientele. Getting a website for your business is very affordable.
\n\n
    9. <b><i>Grab a market position</i></b>\n
    Use all your creativity while launching a startup or small business. Give your startup a great, easy-to-remember name. Company logos are brand ambassadors for your business. Hire a professional logo designer from Fiverr or Upwork to create a unique logo for your business.
\n\n
    This logo will someday herald your superior products and services worldwide. All successful businesses retain the logo or the version they used at launch.
\n\n
    Print official stationery depicting the logo, brand, company name, and contact details. This includes letterheads, envelopes, invoice books, payment vouchers, and other documents required for official transactions.
\n\n
    10. <b><i>More money matters with banks</i></b>\n
    Armed with the company and municipal registration, PAN number, the bank of your choice will open a current account. Before rushing to open a current bank account, check a few details. Ask your banker about overdraft facilities.
\n\n
    This is important to ensure your cheques will never bounce due to scarce funds. A bounced cheque indicates the financial instability of a company or business. You can negotiate how many free cheques you are entitled to annually with the bank.
\n\n
    Check for loans and other facilities given to a small business person like you, such as instant credit on deposited and outstation cheques. If your business needs imported raw material, check for a Letter of Credit facility.
\n\n
    11. <b><i>Getting staffed with low wages</i></b>\n
    This is one prime area of your small business. Usually, most entrepreneurs launch a proverbial one-man show. Some enlist the assistance of family members, including spouses, grown-up kids, siblings, or parents.
\n\n
    This may not always be possible. The best way to get qualified staff at beginner salaries is educational institutes or websites. Almost every training center provides job placement assurance. There are websites like Internshala where you can hire interns for a low salary.
\n\n
    You can register your company with job websites like Indeed and Naukri to get fresh graduates on a stipend basis. This works to upgrade your skills while creating staff for your own small business.
\n\n
    12. <b><i>Publicize your small business</i></b>\n
    Intense competition demands you publicize your small business well. Advertising can cost a fortune and eat heavily into your capital. Using micro-blogging sites such as Twitter to introduce your company combined with a good presence on Facebook serves this purpose.
\n\n
    You can also create a YouTube channel, launch videos of your company, products and services, salient features, and other information on your channel, and upload relevant pictures on Instagram.
\n\n
    A great LinkedIn on for your business will ensure you reach the right network.
\n\n
    You can also use traditional ways to promote your business, like advertising in newspapers, local radio, distributing pamphlets, etc.
\n\n\n\n
    <b><i>Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Industries</i></b>\n
    India\’s MSME Ministry is tasked with developing small businesses &amp; startups, and online businesses. MSME has offices in major cities of each of the Indian states and seven Union Territories. The ministry regulates licensing, rules, and regulations for MSMEs.
\n\n
    It creates and launches various schemes and programs for entrepreneurial development. Schemes like offering funds on soft terms to prospective entrepreneurs are floated regularly by this ministry.
\n\n
    Details about ongoing funding schemes, investment opportunities in various Indian states, training programs and rules, regulations currently in force can be had from the Ministry of MSME.
\n\n
    <b><i>Mudra Bank</i></b>\n
    On April 8, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and Micro Units Development and Refinanced Agency Bank. Getting finance for start-ups, existing small businesses is more accessible from Mudra Bank.
\n\n
    Street vendors are also eligible for credit under Mudra Bank. Business finance under Mudra Bank schemes can be availed from any Public Sector Bank, cooperative banks and authorized financial institutions.
\n\n
    <b><i>A good start translates to healthy returns</i></b>\n
    Having all licenses and permits, proper bank accounts, and agreements with suppliers before launch ensures a great start for your small business at home or online. Recent policies for investors have cut and eliminated red tape to great extent.
\n\n
    Yet bureaucrats accustomed to unhealthy practices tend to pick faults. Reading news related to your business daily. This helps to stay abreast with developments and any new regulations that may come into force.
\n\n
    Are you starting your business from a home, office, or online\? All the best to start your small business in India and for your startup.

    <string name="SA_stringTB57"><b>Why Manufacturing Quality Certifications Help Win Business</b>\n\n\n\n

    For manufacturing companies, attaining and maintaining quality certifications can take a lot of time and effort. However, your certifications can be a powerful sales and marketing tool.
\n\n
    <b><i>Certifications Matter To B2B Buyers</i></b>\n
    Whether it\’s a well-known standard like ISO or ANSI, or a more niche accreditation like QS 9000 or IRIS, quality certifications let buyers know that you can meet their specific standards. It\’s a sign of trust that can separate you from your competitors.
\n\n
    Here\’s a list of some other quality certifications buyers look for to assess your organization:
\n
    <b><i>ACC (The American Chemistry Council)</i></b>\n
    <b><i>AISC (The American Institute Of Steel Construction)</i></b>\n
    <b><i>CEN (European Committee for Standardization)</i></b>\n
    <b><i>CSA (Canadian Standards Association)</i></b>\n
    <b><i>EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency)</i></b>\n
    <b><i>Quest Forum (Quality Excellence for Suppliers of Telecommunications Forum)</i></b>\n
    <b><i>The Foundation for Food Safety Certification</i></b>\n
    <b><i>(ITAR) The International Traffic in Arms Regulation</i></b>\n
\n\n
    In fact, when buyers source for new products and suppliers, quality certifications are important. According to our recent survey, Quality Certifications ranked in the top six of all factors that B2B buyers use to evaluate suppliers.
\n\n
    Unfortunately, suppliers often overlook the importance of their quality certifications when it comes to industrial marketing. As a result, they tend to make it unnecessarily difficult for buyers to find and verify this critical piece of information. It\’s a seemingly minor error that can add up to a huge loss of potential revenue.
\n\n\n
    Don\’t make that mistake. Here are some tips you can use to leverage your quality certifications to win more business:
\n\n
    <b><i>Put Your Certifications Online</i></b>\n
    Buyers are already 70% of the way through the industrial buying process before they reach out and contact a supplier. They do their initial research and discovery online, anonymously. That means your important information — like your quality certifications — need to be online, lest you get eliminated early in the process.
\n\n
    Just listing a bunch of ISO numbers isn\’t sufficient; buyers want to see your certification. This means having high-quality images, with up-to-date certifications at all times.
\n\n
    <i>Make Your Certifications Easy To Find</i>\n
    Don\’t make buyers dig for essential information. Include a link to your quality certifications in your website\’s navigation.
\n
    Beyond your website, you need to put your quality certifications front and center when buyers are looking for the products and services you offer. This means listing your business and maintaining your profile on Thomasnet.com — every second, a buyer visits the platform to source products and services and find a new supplier.
\n
    If you have quality certifications, you need to make sure your potential customers know about them. It could mean the difference between winning new business and being left off the shortlist.
\n
    Quality certifications are just one of the many factors that buyers use to evaluate suppliers — and one of the many items that suppliers consistently overlook.
\n\n

    <b><i>How Manufacturers Present Their Certifications Online</i></b>\n
    There are many different ways that you can present your certifications online. The obvious choice is your company website. Many manufacturers even have site pages entirely dedicated to laying out the different certifications they have because if you have it, flaunt it.
\n\n
    <b><i>A Dedicated Site Page For Certifications</i></b>\n
    Renown Electric, a manufacturer of electric motors and repair company has a certification page on its website so that buyers can see that Renown is a quality business to work with. The motor company lists out all the certifications they have obtained throughout the years within their website\’s side rail section. What\’s unique about this page is that Renown put together a free downloadable offer for their ISO 9001:2015 certificate. Providing a gated downloadable certification goes beyond showing buyers that you\’re a quality supplier, but it also helps improve lead generation efforts.
\n\n
    Similarly, in the example below, Outlook Group has an \”Our Credentials\” section on their website that lists the numerous certifications they have to serve different markets like food and beverage and medical and personal care.
\n\n
    <b><i>Certifications In Your Website Header &amp;amp; Footer</i></b>\n
    Tex Tech Industries is a textile manufacturer that takes full advantage of the certifications they have across multiple content types. An ISO 9001:2015 certification is positioned in both the header and footer of the company website. The footer also showcases its Thomasnet.com badging with a \”Verified Supplier Badge\” and a \”COVID-19 Response Supplier Badge,\” which is also highlighted on the Tex Tech Industries Thomas company profile.
\n\n
    Tex Tech takes its certifications a step further by including it as a main point in a company video. It is stated within the first five seconds of the video that the manufacturer is ISO 9001:2015 certified to reinforce further that they are a \”proven leader in the high-performance materials market.\”

    <i><u>Introduction</u></i>\n
\n
    Rahul Sharma, who ran a carpet manufacturing business from Bhadohi in UP, recently turned 40 and decided to take stock of his life and business. He noticed that while his business was doing well, the growth rate was beginning to stagnate. Since he had significant domain expertise and useful work experience, he decided it was the right time to scale up his business. With an expansion plan in the works, he started looking for options to raise funds. With a multitude of financing options available in the market, Rahul was confused.
\n\n
    While, initially, he considered the possibility of taking a personal loan, the high rate of interest became a non-starter. A friend suggested that he explore the option of availing a loan against his property, since it was a popular option for many like Rahul. From giving immediate access to a large sum of money to flexible repayment options, it scored quite well compared to other forms of financing.
\n\n

    <b><i>What is loan against property\?</i></b>\n

    A loan against property (LAP), also known as a mortgage loan is a secured form of personal loan. The loans are given out against the security of your assets pledged as collateral and can be availed by both self-employed and salaried individuals.
\n\n
    The collateralised asset can be a residential building, a commercial building, or a combination of both. The loan amount is decided based on the market value of this property and your repayment capability.
\n\n
    Since the lenders have more security, lenders have less risk and the borrower enjoys a better term compared to its unsecured counterpart. The loans can be taken for funding business expansion plans, meeting children\’s education and marriage expenses, among others.
\n\n
    However, in the event of failure to repay the loan, the lender is entitled to sell the pledged assets to recoup the loss incurred.
\n\n\n
    <i><b>batures of loan against property\?</b></i>\n
\n
    Some of the key features of loan against property are:
\n
    <u>Simple Eligibility Criteria</u>\n

    As the loans issued are covered by the property of the owner, the eligibility criteria are very simple. Any self-employed and salaried individual with a stable income source and good credit score can apply for the loan.
\n\n
    <u>Lower Interest Rate</u>\n

    As the lender undertakes less risk on advancing mortgage loans, the loans have a lower interest rate compared to its unsecured equivalent. This allows easy and quick repayments.
\n\n
    <u>High Loan Amount and Longer Repayment Tenor</u>\n

    The borrower can avail up to 75% value of the property pledged as collateral and enjoy a flexible and longer repayment tenor. The repayment tenure can be as long as 15 years, which makes repayment instalments affordable.
\n\n
    <u>Simple Documentation and Quick Processing</u>\n

    The mortgage loans have a simple documentation process with quick turnaround time, provided all eligibility criteria is fulfilled.
\n
    LAP application has faster approval rate than home loans as the property already exists and is easier to ascertain the market value.
\n\n
    <b>Why Take a Loan Against Property\?</b>
\n
    Loan against property offers multiple benefits to borrowers, which makes it a highly recommended loan option for every category of individuals.
\n\n
    Following are the benefits associated with a loan against property:
\n
    <i>Optimum Use of your Property</i>\n

    Loan against property allows you to unlock the hidden value of your property and use it to meet urgent financial requirements.
\n\n
    <i>Continuous Ownership</i>\n

    In the LAP, you never lose the ownership of the property mortgaged during the loan tenor. As defined under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the term mortgage means \”transfer of interest\” in a specific property for securing an advance by way of loan.
\n\n
    And, for any reason, if you default on the loan, then you have the option to sell the property and settle the loan. Further, you can keep the surplus cash from the sale proceeds and start afresh after the settlement of the loan.
\n\n
    <i>Pre-Closure Benefits</i>\n

    In LAP, no penalty is charged on prepaying the loan, except if the loan is issued on fixed-interest terms. Therefore, you can reduce your overall interest burden and tenure by repaying a small additional amount regularly.
\n\n
    The benefit is not extended to business or corporate entities.
\n\n
    <i>Re-Financing</i>\n

    Business owners who are in continuous need of funds to meet business expenses can refinance the loan to increase the loan amount.
\n\n
    The same property can be used multiple times at the latest market valuation for business expansion.
\n\n
    <i>Loans Availed can be Used for Multiple Purposes</i>\n

    Since LAP is a secured form of personal loan, there are no restrictions on the purpose of utilizing the loan amount. The discretion on use of the loan amount completely rests on the borrower with no interference of the lender.
\n\n
    The loan amount can be used for funding education of your children or meeting upcoming marriage expenses or financing business expansion. You can also use LAP for buying a new property or asset, which otherwise does not qualify for a loan.
\n\n
    <i>Tax Benefits</i>\n

    As LAP comes under the category of personal loans, many borrowers are unaware of the tax benefits. However, the tax benefits depend on the end usage of the loan.
\n\n
    Under Section 37(1), the interest paid and other costs incurred like processing fee and documentation charges can be claimed as business expenditure
\n\n
    If the loan amount is used for purchasing house property, the interest paid can be claimed for tax deduction under Section 24(b). The maximum amount of Rs 2 lakh can be claimed in a financial year.
\n\n
    But, there is no tax benefit on the principal repayment of LAP.
\n\n
    <b>How much loan can you get\?</b>\n

    There are multiple factors based on which the lender decide on the loan amount. Following are the factors which affect the quantum of your loan amount:
\n\n
    <i>Age of the Applicant</i>\n

    <i>Employment Status</i> (for salaried class)\n

    <i>Income of the Applicant</i> ( for both salaried and self-employed)\n

    <i>Status of Leverage Property</i> ( Documents and Insurance)\n

    <i>Regularity in Filing of Income Tax Returns</i>\n

    <i>Credit Score of the Applicant</i>\n

    <i>Loan Tenure</i>\n

    Depending on all the eligibility factors, the lenders offer up to 50-75% of the property value as a loan. The remaining value of the property is held as margin money. This ensures protection to lenders from real estate price fluctuation that may affect the property valuation.
\n\n
    <b><i>What can Loan Against Property be used for\?</i></b>\n

    There are no usage restrictions on loan against property by the lender and borrowers are free to decide on the loan proceeds.
    The loans are generally taken for funding important life goals and among other things. \n
    They are:
\n
    <i>For children\’s higher education</i>\n

    <i>Wedding</i>\n

    <i>Meeting medical emergencies</i>\n

    <i>To purchase a new property</i>\n

    <i>Foreign Vacation</i>\n

    <i>To start a new business</i>\n

    <i>For meeting funding requirements for business expansion</i>\n
\n
    However, the loan proceeds cannot be used for speculative purposes or for illegal activities.
\n

\n
    Choosing and selecting a factory location rightfully is a difficult task for entrepreneurs, especially for beginners. A right plant location is a \’make or break\’ decision from an owner\’s point of view.
\n\n
    The location of the business is the most important factor influencing its success or failure. It is a long-term decision which should take into consideration not only the present requirements of the organization but also its future expansion plans. Choosing an inappropriate factory location may be very difficult and expensive to rectify.
\n\n
    The location of a plant has a bearing on the layout of machinery and equipment as well as on the process of production. There is no ideal location for all firms or even for one firm at all times. The choice of location depends on several important factors. It is influenced by the kind of products being manufactured, the costs of production and distribution.
\n\n
    A sound business plan should be the foundation of your site-selection process, detailing facts including the goods the plant will produce, the number of goods the plant will produce, five years of production planning, future growth expectations.
\n\n\n



    The objective of a locational plan is to find out the optimum or best location for the particular plant.
    Such a location not only results in the lowest cost per unit but also facilitates the orderly growth of the firm. \n
    In this article, we intend to explore 14 things to consider in selecting a factory location.\n\n

    #1. <i>Availability of Raw Materials</i>\n
    Raw materials are the basic components of finished products. This is one of the most important considerations when selecting a factory location.
\n\n
    If your required raw materials are perishable items, then you must tend to locate the plant nearer to the raw material source. Otherway, it also reduces the transportation cost which affects hugely the cost of the production.
\n\n
    #2. <i>Proximity to Market</i>\n
    Every finished product needs to go to the market for consumer consumption. Here also transportation overhead increases the cost of the finished product.
\n
    In case you are initiating a fully export-oriented plant, the availability of processing facilities gains importance in deciding the location of one\’s industry. Export Promotion Zones (EPZ) are such examples.
\n\n
    #3. <i>Infrastructural Facilities</i>\n
    This is important in view of the fact that all supporting services required for the successful operation of the plant. The availability of communication facilities is also an important part of the infrastructure.
\n
    Existing vibrant infrastructure in the vicinity is much preferred than the need-based infrastructure getting developed after the plant commissioning.
\n\n
    #4. <i>Government Policy</i>\n
    The Government offers several incentives, concessions, tax holidays for a few years, cheaper power supply, factory shed, etc., to attract the entrepreneurs to set up industries in less developed and backward areas. In this scenario, you must prioritize this factor in selecting a factory location.
\n\n
    #5. <i>Neighbours</i>\n
    Neighbours play the sometimes vital role in getting licenses permissions from different Govt. authority. If you are establishing the plant near a domestic area, then authorities may ask you to get a \’No Objection\’ from your neighbours.
\n\n
    #6. <i>Availability of Manpower</i>\n
    Local availability of skilled and semi-skilled manpower will add to the efficient running of the plant. Besides, you must study labor relations through turnover rates, absenteeism, and liveliness of trade unionism in a particular area.
\n\n
    #7. <i>Availability Of Utilities</i>\n
    Utilities like electricity, water resources, etc. play an important role in almost every factory operations. Stable and uninterrupted power is a required magnitude, without fluctuations in voltage and frequency is important for the successful operation of the plant.
\n\n
    #8. <i>Local Laws, Regulations, and Taxation</i>\n
    You must check prior to the laws related to the pollution control board. In food products, you must check the FPO regulations. In the case of the wood industry, you must maintain the distance from forestry. Taxation is also an important factor as well as State Subject.
\n
    In some highly competitive consumer products, its high quantum may turn out to be the negative factor while its relief may become the final deciding factor for some other industry.
\n\n
    #9. <i>Ecology &amp; Pollution</i>\n
    Nowadays, there is a great deal of awareness towards the maintenance of natural ecological balance. Regarding the effect of pollution from the specific type of plants, social obligations are to be met.
\n
    The nature of the site selected should preferably have some advantages to meet these requirements. You must be careful about effluent disposal, in the cases it needed.
\n\n
    #10. <i>Distance from Your Residence</i>\n
    Yes, it\’s important. In a small scale factory operation, an entrepreneur self-plays a vital role. You should not select a place that has adequate distance from your own residence.
\n\n
    #11.  <i>Competition</i>\n
    If you are dealing with an innovative product and your plant is in an industrial zone, then you might face competition in manufacturing automation from other companies.
\n\n
    #12. <i>Incentives, Land costs. Subsidies for Backward Areas</i>\n
    In some cases, the Government offers several incentives, concessions, tax holidays, cheaper lands, assured and cheaper power supply, price concessions for departmental (state) purchases, etc. to make the backward areas also conducive for setting up industries. You must take into consideration these issues in selecting a factory location.
\n\n
    #13.  <i>Climatic Conditions</i>\n
    Climatic conditions affect both people and manufacturing activity. Additionally, certain industries require a specific type of climatic conditions to produce their goods. For example, jute and textile manufacturing industries require high humidity.
\n\n
    #14. <i>Political conditions</i>\n
    The stability of the political environment is essential for industrial growth. It builds confidence and political instability causes a lack of confidence among the prospective and present entrepreneurs to venture into the industry which is filled with risks.
\n
    Hence, the most advantageous location is that at which the cost of gathering material and fabricating it plus the cost of distributing the finished product to the customers will be at a minimum. The choice of an optimum location requires a judicious balancing of all these factors.
\n
    This list of 14 things to consider in selecting a factory location definitely helps you to get almost the right plant location for your manufacturing operation.

    2. <b><i>OVERVIEW OF THE SSI/MSME SECTOR</i></b>\n\n
    <i>2.1</i> Prior to implementation of
    MSMED Act, 2006, the sector
    was defined, as per the provision
    of Industrial Development and
    Regulation (IDR) Act 1951, as
    Small Scale Industries (SSI)
    sector and its constituent tiny
    and auxiliary units as per
    periodic revision of criteria for
    defining such units. The scope
    and coverage of the MSME
    s e c t o r w e r e b r o a d e n e d
    significantly under the MSMED
    Act, 2006, which recognized the
    concept of \”enterprise\” and to
    include both manufacturing and
    services sectors, besides
    defining the medium enterprises
    under MSME Sector. Thus, the
    entire non-agricultural sector of
    economy was brought under the coverage of MSME Sector subject to the
    revised criteria prescribed for defining Micro, Small and Medium
    Enterprises separately for manufacturing and services sectors.
     <i>2.2</i> In accordance with the provision of Micro, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises
    Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 the Micro, Small and Medium
    Enterprises (MSME) are classified in two Classes:


    a) <b><i>Manufacturing Enterprises</i></b> - The enterprises engaged in the
    manufacture or production of goods pertaining to any industry specified
    in the first schedule to the industries (Development and regulation) Act,
    1951) or employing plant and machinery in the process of value addition
    to the final product having a distinct name or character or use. The
    Manufacturing Enterprise is defined in terms of investment in
    Plant &amp; Machinery.
    UDYOG AADHAAR 3
    (b) <b><i>Service Enterprises</i></b>: The enterprises engaged in providing or
    rendering of services and are defined in terms of investment in
    equipment.

    3. <b><i>Entrepreneurs Memorandum</i></b> (EM-I &amp;II):\n
    Subsequent to the implementation of
    Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
    Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 with
    effect from October 2006, filing of
    Entrepreneurs Memorandum Part I
    and II came into vogue for proposed and
    existing enterprises respectively. As
    per the provisions of the said Act, filing
    of EM-I was discretionary in nature.
    However, MSMEs file EM-II at District
    Industries Centers (DICs) in respective States/UTs, after commencement of
    the project.

    The MSME sector has shown consistent growth during 2007-2015 in terms of
    number of EM-II filed with the District Industries Centers across the country.
    The National Portal with only 14 States and UTs on-board has shown a
    significant improvement in online filing of EM-I and EM-II within a short time
    that further proves that there is a need for a hassle free eco-system of
    registration that may lead towards formalization of economy.

    4. <b><i>Universalization of Registration</i></b>
    The present registration process of EM
    has also been commented by the
    Kamath Committee. \”The major issue
    lies not with the registration process as
    per the MSMED Act, 2006 but with the
    conditions applied by the local DICs.
    There are localized rules and
    requirements which could vary even
    from district to district within the same
    state, which may result in delays in
    receiving the EM II acknowledgement\”. The Committee suggests the
    following measures to minimize such delays:
    <i>4.1</i> Deemed acceptance of registration (EM II) within pre-defined time
    frame. This could be a time period of one week from the filing of the online
    registration form. Since the form is proposed for self-declaration clause,
    all requisite verification can be done by the DICs subsequent to
    acceptance.
    <i>4.2</i> Since procedures like land allotment which are under the state
    governments entail collection of information, it is suggested that no
    conditions should be imposed by the state government/DICs for
    acceptance of registration.
    <i>4.3</i> The requirement of no-objection certificate with relation to pollution
    norms can be discontinued. This activity is already been carried out by
    the Pollution Control Department and the self-declaration by the MSME
    can be suitably worded to cover this aspect. If necessary, a negative list for
    industries where pollution certificate is required may be prepared.
    <i>4.4</i> A mobile application with an easy-to-use interface should be used to
    augment the registration process. Registration can be encouraged by
    providing incentives for registering with the authority which could
    include benefits such as insurance for a nominal fee or free of cost, credit
    ratings for MSMEs at low rates and tax holiday for a limited time period. It
    UDYOG AADHAAR
    may be useful to have a basic form such that 95% of MSMEs including
    most micro enterprises are eligible for a single-form based basic
    registration/facilitation and a full form is needed only for the remaining
    5% MSMEs. Even for these 5% MSMEs, the form should be simplified
    and based on self-certification with follow on validation by industry
    associations certified by the Authority on the lines of the BMO model in
    Germany, as detailed later in this chapter. The facility can be extended to
    have the ability to open a bank account entirely online using eKYC
    (electronic validation of KYC requirement).


    5. <b><i>Udyog Aadhaar Memorandum</i></b>

    As per the recommendations made by Kamath Committee, the Ministry of
    MSME, in consultation with the National Board of MSMEs and the Advisory
    Committee in this behalf, has prepared a one-page registration form that would
    constitute a self- declaration format under which the MSME will self-certify its
    existence, bank account details, promoter/owner\’s Aadhaar details and other
    minimum basic information required. Based on the same, the MSMEs can be
    issued online, a unique identifier i.e. Udyog Aadhaar Number.
    The Ministry of MSME has set up the infrastructure i.e. the Udyog Aadhaar
    (UA) Portal (http://udyogaadhaar.gov.in) for online filing of Udyog Aadhaar
    Memorandum (UAM) by enterprises located anywhere in the country. The UA
    portal is also accessible on mobile devices. The procedure for filing Udyog
    Aadhaar Memorandum has been notified (refer Appendix).

    6. <b><i>Benefits of filing Udyog Aadhaar Memorandum</i></b>

    Udyog Aadhaar registration will
    enable the units/enterprises to seek
    information and apply online about
    various services being offered by all
    Ministries and Departments.
    Earlier only medium enterprises were
    insisted to file EM2 as it was very
    cumbersome to file, the simplified

    Udyog Aadhaar will enable all
    enterprises to file and register
    themselves so that simply by using
    Udyog Aadhaar Number, they can
    access other services.    The process of obtaining Udyog
    Aadhaar Number is free-of cost, paperless and results in instant registration.

    9. <b><i>Highlights</i></b>\n\n

    (i) <u>Having Aadhaar Number is not mandatory for registering an MSME
    under Udyog Aadhaar.</u>\n
    The Udyog Aadhaar Registration can be done online by individuals
    themselves in case they have an Aadhaar number. However, in all
    exceptional cases, including those of not having Aadhaar number, can
    still file Udyog Aadhaar Memorandum ,in offline mode(i.e. on paper
    form), with the General Manager(GM) of the concerned District
    Industries Centre(DIC). The same has also been notified in the gazette
    dated 18-09-15.\n
    The persons having Aadhaar numbers, by virtue of having provided the
    demographic as well as biometric details to the state, once and for all,
    indeed enjoy a greater ease of registration at the UAM portal.
    Within a short span of time, more than 38,000 registrations have taken
    place on the UAM portal owing to the simplified process of registration of
    MSME units.\n
    (ii) <u>Udyog Aadhaar Memorandum for States with Less Coverage under
    Aadhaar.</u>\n
    Some of the States have less than adequate coverage till date as per the
    UIDAI data. It has been clarified to such States, such as Assam that the
    option of assisted filing of UAM in offline mode with the GM (DIC) could
    be resorted to. Aadhaar number is not a mandatory requirement when
    the States/UTs have offices in the Districts headed by GM (DICs) and
    whose primary role is to promote and facilitate industries in the District.
    The UAM can be filled through the concerned GM (DIC).
    The States/UTs have been asked to sensitize their District Industries
    Centers for a proactive role in Udyog Aadhaar.
    \n
    (iii) <u>Single System of Registration for MSMEs- Udyog Aadhaar
    Memorandum</u>\n
    Prior to 18-09-15, when the Entrepreneurs\’ Memorandum-II was filled
    with the GM (DIC), heterogeneous systems were in vogue. Some States
    had their own online systems for registering MSMEs, some were using
    the national portal created by Ministry of MSME and some (around 10
    states) were continuing with the manual (paper form) system of filing
    EM-II.\n
    The new system of Udyog Aadhaar offers convergence of all
    heterogeneous systems to a single system of registration. The system is
    capable of delivering assured ease of doing business where the UIDAI
    has coverage i.e. 92% of the country\’s adult population.
    The Udyog Aadhaar portal has suitable provisions for sharing State/
    District specific data of registrations under Udyog Aadhaar with the
    respective States/ Districts. This initiative of maintaining the data on
    MSMEs with Ministry of MSME is likely to save cost in the long run since
    States/UTs would no longer be requiring maintaining the same.
    \n\n
    (iv) <u>The Genesis of Udyog Aadhaar</u>\n
    The ministry for micro, small and medium enterprises had last month
    notified Udyog Aadhaar, taking a cue from the prime minister\’s radio
    show Mann Ki Baat, where he had talked about simplifying procedures to
    start a business with a single-page registration form.
    A large chunk of enterprises in India are simply not registered due to the
    cumbersome paperwork involved in the process and, therefore, can\’t tap
    the government schemes for them. The KV Kamath panel on financing
    the MSME sector, that has been the biggest job creator in recent years,
    had recommended that the registration should be universalized.
    The concept of Udyog Aadhaar and ease of registration have thus
    originated to ensure wider coverage of MSMEs to avail the benefits under
    various Schemes of Central/ State governments.

    <b><u>FAQ\’s</u></b>\n\n

    <i>Q1</i>- Has EM-I/II been replaced by UAM\?\n
    <i>Yes</i>. After the notification dated
    18-09-2015, filing of EM-I/II by
    States/should be
    discouraged and instead all

    the filing of UAM on the portal
    created by Ministry of MSME
    i.e.http://udyogaadhaar.gov.in\n\n
    <i>Q2</i>- What is the date for adopting
    the UAM and stopping EM-I
    andEM-II\?\n
    It is clarified that once the UAM has been notified dated 18-09-15, there

    under process till 18-09-2015 may be accepted.\n\n
    <i>Q3</i>- Whether the multiple system of registration may exist after
    introduction of UAM\?\n
    All other online/ offline systems of registration of MSMEs created and
    maintained by Central/State/UT Governments should cease to register
    new MSMEs forthwith. Such online platforms may be allowed to exist
    for the time being to enable access to useful legacy data for decision
    making. Henceforth, there should be only one system i.e. UAM for the
    registration of new MSME units.\n\n
    <i>Q4</i>- Whether States/UTs have access to reports/ query and such other
    functions as may be required by GM (DIC)/ Directorate of
    Industries on the UAM portal\?\n
    The Udyog Aadhaar portal has been envisaged to take care of this
    requirement
    UDYOG AADHAAR \n\n
    <i>Q5</i>- How to select NIC Code of the Activity performed by the enterprise.\n
    NIC code can be selected once the aadhaar number is validated and
    major activity (manufacturing or service) is selected. In order to
    simplify the selection of appropriate NIC code, a three-stage drop-down
    list is available to the users.\n\n
    <i>Q6</i>- Is there a provision to verify the UAM credentials by the
    procurement agencies including government departments and
    PSUs\?\n
    NIC has been advised to suitably provide this provision in a way that
    several e-procurement portals in the country, created by the
    government or private but being used by the government could benefit
    from the UAM portal in so far as online verification of a MSME unit is
    concerned.\n\n
    <i>Q7</i>- Is there a difference in the information sought under EM-I/II and
    the new UAM\?\n
    In order to promote ease of doing business for MSMEs, it has been
    decided to seek lesser information than EM-I/II in the UAM.\n\n
    <i>Q8</i>- Howtosubmitthe supportingdocumentswhile filingUAMonline\?
    The information sought is on self-certification basis and no supporting
    documents are required at the time of online filing of UAM.\n\n
    <i>Q9</i>- What would be the role of \”Udyog Bandhu\” in the UAM\?\n
    The role of facilitating the creation and growth of enterprises in the
    States/UTs is not proposed to change in any manner whatsoever
    through UAM. The concept of \”Udyog Bandhu\” may therefore not be
    affected by UAM.\n\n
    <i>Q10</i>- Whether the new system of UAM encapsulates the change in the
    line of production\?\n
    Yes, since the new system constitutes self declaration format, the
    change in the line of productions accordingly may be incorporated.
    UDYOG AADHAAR 16.\n\n
    <i>Q11</i>- What would happen to those enterprises which do not have
    AadhaarNumber\?\n
    At present Aadhaar Number is mandatory for registration under UAM.
    However, the GoI will find a way out for covering those cases where
    Aadhaar Number is not available.\n\n
    <i>Q12</i>- EM-I filed by a prospective enterprise entitles it for certain
    exemptionsfrompayingstamp-duties.Howtohandle thisin UAM\?\n
    Legally, the EM-I/II ceases to exist after 18-09-15. States/UTs may
    encourage providing all benefits/concessions to MSMEs based on
    UAM only.\n\n
    <i>Q13</i>- Is there a provision for editing of information in UAM data of an
    enterprise by GM (DIC)\?\n
    No. However, GM DICs, on the UAM portal, shall be able to enter their
    remarks on the respective information provided by the entrepreneurs
    while filing the UAM online.\n\n
    <i>Q14</i>- What is the future of EM Portal created by Miistry of MSME i.e.
    http://em.msme.gov.in\?\n
    New registrations in the EM Portal have been stopped forthwith.\n\n
    <i>Q15</i>- Who has access to the data from the UAM portal\?\n
    The UAM Portal shall have suitable provisions to allow officials of the
    State Governments including GM DICs to have password protected
    access to data of their jurisdiction.\n\n
    <i>Q16</i>- Whether the new system of registration provides NIC Code in
    Hindi and English\?\n
    Presently the NIC Codes are only available in English. However, the
    same may be made available in Hindi in due course.\n\n
    <i>Q17</i>- What is the monitoring mechanism available to Director
    (Industries) and GM (DICs) fornew registration underUAM\?\n
    Since the UAM is being filing on self certification basis and the UAN is
    generated instantly, there cannot be any monitoring of the registration
    UDYOG AADHAAR 17
    process.\n However, the enterprises filing the UAM online are liable to
    provide documentary proof of information provided in the UAM,
    wherever necessary, to the Central Government, State Government or
    such person as may be authorized.\n\n
    <i>Q18</i>- Some Disclaimer should be added in UAN.\n
    Notification clearly states that the UAM filed is on self declaration basis.
    Therefore, no separate disclaimer is required.\n\n
    <i>Q19</i>- Why power load details have not been asked in UAM\?\n
    Power load indicates the requirement of energy to the MSME unit. This
    has no relevance to the activity of the enterprise and the subject matter
    is dealt by the State/UT Governments.\n\n
    <i>Q20</i>- Will there be any updating of data by the entrepreneurs on the
    UAM portal\?\n
    The legacy of SSI registration and EM-I/II does not mandate for
    updation and the same used to be filed as a one-time exercise on the part
    of MSME units. The same is proposed to continue.\n\n
    <i>Q21</i>- How the closing of the business unit is recorded the entrepreneur
    in the UAM\?\n
    It may not be made obligatory for the closing unit to inform about it to
    the State/UT concerned or the UAM portal

    <string name="SA_stringTB63"><b>Shop and Establishment Act Registration/License</b>\n\n\n\n

    Every state has its own Shop and Establishment Act (\”Act\”). However, the general provisions of the Act are the same in all states. The Shop and Establishment Act is regulated by the Labour Department of the respective states. The Act regulates all the shops and commercial establishments operating within the state.

    <string name="SA_stringTB74"><b>Registering for IPR in India\? Here\’s a step-by-step guide</b>\n\n\n


    Registering for an IPR may seem a long drawn out process, but once you get the IP registered in your name, the effort will be worth it.\n
    If we look at the properties of Intellectual property, they can be segregated into two main categories – tangible and intangible. Utility designs, work processes, artistic works, logo designs, geographical indications and other such novel creations that allow the individual or business developing them to reap monetary benefits.\n
\n
    Every inventor has the right to monopolise their invention and ensure no one else duplicates it for monetary gains. This is where IPR plays a critical role. As such, they need to protect their creations by registering patents, copyrights, trademarks and/or industrial designs. For this, an inventor is required to follow a due intellectual property right registration process, and here\’s a step-by-step guide on how IPRs are registered in India.
\n
    <b><i>Registering intellectual property rights in India</i></b>\n
    Irrespective of whether an individual or a business requires an IPR, it\’s advisable to hire a professional well-versed in the field of intellectual property registration to guide you through the registration process for your IP. Here\’s what you need to do.
\n\n
    <b><i>Fill out the application form</i></b>\n
    While filling out the IPR application form, it is important to create a triplicate application that has both the applicant\’s and the agent\’s signatures. Besides the application, the applicant must also submit a statement of the case that explains how and why the invention is unique.
\n\n
    <b><i>Preliminary analysis and examination</i></b>\n
    An examiner will evaluate the application for any deficiencies after it gets submitted. If there are any, they will be required to be fixed within a month of filing the application. A group of experts who are well-versed with this category of IPR will also assess the content of the statement to ascertain the accuracy and the validity of the particulars furnished. The analyst will then issue an examination report.
\n\n
    <b><i>Objections are communicated via a show-cause notice</i></b>\n
    The applicants are informed in case the registrar has an issue with the application. The objection raised needs to be responded to within a stipulated timeline of two months., after receipt of the communication. Some applicants also apply for a hearing and can make an appeal request for the same within a month. In case they are unable to communicate the case strongly to the registrar, the latter has the right to withdraw the application despite being presented with the opportunity to appeal.
\n\n
    <b><i>Publication in the IPR journal</i></b>\n
    The application then gets published in the IPR Journal within three months of the registrar accepting it.
\n\n
    <b><i>Opposition of registration</i></b>\n
    Another inventor with a similar product may file a notice of opposition, after viewing the applicant\’s invention in the IPR journal. If any person has any objection to the application, they must submit the opposition notice within three months. The applicant receives a copy of the opposition notice from the registrar, and they will have two months to send counterstatement. If they fail to submit the counter-statement, the registrar deems the applicant has forfeited application. Both, the applicant and the party filing the notice of opposition will have to provide evidence through supporting documents and affidavits. They may also have to make the case through a formal hearing with the registrar.
\n\n
    <b><i>IPR registration</i></b>\n
    IPR registration is the final step. Once the IPR application gets accepted, the applicant receives a seal stating that they are the rightful owner of the IPR.
\n
    The process of registering IPR may sometimes appear time-consuming, but it is worth the effort. Before deciding to register an IP, it is essential to ensure that no other party has invented or created a similar product or design. Doing homework before filing for IPR can expedite the intellectual property rights registration process, helping the applicant gain sole credit for their inventions.

\n\n
    <b><i>Ideal Forms of Business Organization</i></b>\n
    In choosing the right forms of business organization for your enterprise, you must consider the characteristics of an ideal form of organization. \n
    These are as follows:\n

    - The formation process should be easy and simple. \n
    - The formation should not involve many legal formalities and it should not be time-consuming.\n
    - The form of organization should facilitate the raising of the required amount of capital at a reasonable cost. If the enterprise requires a large amount of capital, the preconditions for attracting capital from the public area) safety of investment b) fair return on investment and c) transferability of the holding.\n
    - A business enterprise may be organized on the basis of either limited or unlimited liability.\n
    \n\n
    From the point of view of risk, limited liability is preferable.\n
    The responsibility for management must be in the hands of the owners of the firm. The day-to-day operation and management operations should take care of properly.\n
    Stability is essential for any business concern. Uninterrupted existence enables the entrepreneur to formulate long‐term plans for the development of the business concern.\n\n\n


    <i><u>How To Choose The Right Type of Business Organization</u></i>\n
    According to the desired parameters, choosing the right forms of business organization is most crucial in starting any business. The choice of the form of business is governed by several interrelated and interdependent factors such as:\n

    <i>Nature Of The Business</i>: This is one of the most important factors you should consider in choosing forms of business organization. Businesses providing direct services like tailors, restaurants, and professional services like doctors, lawyers are generally organized as proprietary concerns. While businesses requiring pooling of skills and funds like accounting firms are better organized as partnerships. However, the manufacturing organizations of the large size commonly demand set up as private and public companies.\n
    <i>Scale Of Operation</i>: Large-scale enterprises catering to national and international markets can be organized more successfully as private or public companies. Small and medium scale firms are generally set up as partnerships and proprietorships.\n
    <i>Degree Of Control</i>: An individual who desires direct control of business prefers proprietorship because a company involves separation of ownership and management.\n
    <i>Capital Requirement</i>: Capital investment plays a major role in choosing the right forms of business organization. However, you can convert a partnership company into a company when it grows beyond the capacity and resources of a few persons.\n\n
    <u>The volume of risks and liabilities as well as the willingness of the owners to bear it is also an important consideration in choosing the right business entity.</u>\n
\n\n\n
    <i><u>List of 8 Different Forms of Business Organization</u></i>
    #1. <i><b>Sole Proprietorship Company</b></i>\n
    The term \’sole\’ means single and \’proprietorship\’ means \’ownership\’. So, only one person is the owner of the sole proprietorship type of business organization. This is a specific type of business unit where one person is solely responsible for providing the capital and bearing the risk of the enterprise, and for the management of the business.
\n
    The owner himself/herself manages the business as per his/her own skill and intelligence. There is no separation of ownership and management as is the case with a company form of business organization.

    <string name="SA_stringTB77"><b>One Person Company Registration – OPC Registration Procedure in India</b>\n\n\n\n

    A new concept has been introduced in the Company\’s Act 2013, about the One Person Company (OPC). In a Private Company, a minimum of 2 Directors and 2 Members are required whereas in a Public Company, a minimum of 3 Directors and a minimum of 7 members. A single person could not incorporate a Company previously.
\n
    One Person Company (OPC) is a company incorporated by a single person. Before the enforcement of the Companies Act, 2013, a single person could not establish a company. If an individual wanted to establish his business, he/she could opt only for a sole proprietorship as there had to be a minimum of two directors and two members to establish a company.
\n
    As per Section 2(62) of the Company\’s Act 2013, a company can be formed with just 1 Director and 1 member. It is a form of a company where the compliance requirements are lesser than that of a private company.
\n
    The Companies Act, 2013 provides that an individual can form a company with one single member and one director. The director and member can be the same person. \n
    Thus, one person company means one individual who may be a resident or NRI can incorporate his/her business that has the features of a company and the benefits of a sole proprietorship.
\n\n\n
    <b><i>Advantages Of OPC</i></b>:\n
    - Legal status\n
    The OPC receives a separate legal entity status from the member. The separate legal entity of the OPC gives protection to the single individual who has incorporated it. The liability of the member is limited to his/her shares, and he/she is not personally liable for the loss of the company.  Thus, the creditors can sue the OPC and not the member or director.
\n\n
    - Easy to obtain funds\n
    Since OPC is a private company, it is easy to go for fundraising through venture capitals, angel investors, incubators etc. The Banks and the Financial Institutions prefer to grant loans to a company rather than a proprietorship firm. Thus, it becomes easy to obtain funds.
\n\n
    - Less compliances\n
    The Companies Act, 2013 provides certain exemptions to the OPC with relation to compliances. The OPC need not prepare the cash flow statement. The company secretary need not sign the books of accounts and annual returns and be signed only by the director.
\n\n
    - Easy incorporation\n
    It is easy to incorporate OPC as only one member and one nominee is required for its incorporation. The member can be the director also. The minimum authorised capital for incorporating OPC is Rs.1 lakh but there is no minimum paid-up capital requirement. Thus, it is easy to incorporate as compared to the other forms of company.
\n\n
    - Easy to manage\n
    Since a single person can establish and run the OPC, it becomes easy to manage its affairs. It is easy to make decisions, and the decision-making process is quick. The ordinary and special resolutions can be passed by the member easily by entering them into the minute book and signed by the sole member. Thus, running and managing the company is easy as there won\’t be any conflict or delay within the company.
\n\n
    - Perpetual succession\n
    The OPC has the feature of perpetual succession even when there is only one member. While incorporating the OPC, the single-member needs to appoint a nominee. Upon the member\’s death, the nominee will run the company in the member\’s place.
\n\n\n


   <b><i>Disadvantages Of OPC</i></b>: \n
    - Suitable for only small business\n
    OPC is suitable for small business structure. The maximum number of members the OPC can have is one at all times. More members or shareholders cannot be added to OPC to raise further capital. Thus, with the expansion and growth of the business, more members cannot be added.
\n\n
    - Restriction of business activities\n
    The OPC cannot carry out Non-Banking Financial Investment activities, including the investments in securities of anybody corporates. It cannot be converted to a company with charitable objects mentioned under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.
\n\n
    - Ownership and management\n
    Since the sole member can also be the director of the company, there will not be a clear distinction between ownership and management. The sole member can take and approve all decisions. The line between ownership and control is blurred, which might result in unethical business practices.
\n\n\n


    <b><i><u>One Person Company (OPC) Registration Process</u></i></b>\n

    Step 1: <b><i>Apply for DSC</i></b>\n
    The first step is to obtain the Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) of the proposed Director which required the following documents:\n

    - Address proof\n
    - Aadhaar card\n
    - PAN card\n
    - Photo\n
    - Email Id\n
    - Phone number

\n\n
    Step 2: <b><i>Apply for DIN</i></b>\n
    Once the Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) is made, the next step is to apply for the Director Identification Number (DIN) of the proposed Director in SPICe Form along with the name and the address proof of the director. Form DIR-3 is the option only available for existing companies. It means with effect from January 2018, the applicant need not file Form DIR-3 separately. Now DIN can be applied within the SPICe form for up to three directors.
\n
    Step 3: <b><i>Name Approval Application</i></b>\n
    The next step while incorporating an OPC is to decide on the name of the Company. The name of the Company will be in the form of \”ABC (OPC) Private Limited\”.
\n
    The name can be approved in the Form SPICe+ 32 application. Only one preferred name along with the significance of keeping that name can be given in the Form SPICe+ 32 application. If the name gets rejected, another name can be submitted by applying another Form SPICe+ 32 application.
\n
    Once the name is approved by the MCA we move on to the next step.
\n\n
    Step 4: <b><i>Documents Required</i></b>\n
    We have to prepare the following documents which are required to be submitted to the ROC:
\n
    The Memorandum of Association (MoA) which are the objects to be followed by the Company or stating the business for which the company is going to be incorporated.\n
    The Articles of the Association (AoA) lays down the by-laws on which the company will operate.\n
    Since there are only 1 Director and a member, a nominee on behalf of such a person has to be appointed because in case he becomes incapacitated or dies and cannot perform his duties the nominee will perform on behalf of the director and take his place. His consent in Form INC – 3 will be taken along with his PAN card and Aadhar Card.\n
    Proof of the Registered office of the proposed Company along with the proof of ownership and a NOC from the owner.\n
    Declaration and Consent of the proposed Director of Form INC -9 and DIR – 2 respectively.
    A declaration by the professional certifying that all compliances have been made.\n\n
    Step 5: Filing of Forms With MCA\n
    All these documents will be attached to the SPICe Form, SPICe-MOA and SPICe-AOA along with the DSC of the Director and the professional, and will be uploaded to the MCA site for approval. The Pan Number and TAN is generated automatically at the time of incorporation of the Company. There is no need to file separate applications for obtaining PAN Number and TAN.
\n\n
    Step 6: <b><i>Issue of the Certificate of Incorporation</i></b>\n\n\n
    On verification, the Registrar of Companies (ROC) will issue a Certificate of Incorporation and we can commence our business.
\n
    - Checklist For Registering OPC\n
    - Minimum and Maximum of one member.\n
    - A nominee should be appointed before incorporation.\n

    <string name="string_termsnconditions">By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You\’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You\’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn\’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Kanglei Admin.

Kanglei Admin is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The Startup Ideas - Tutorials, Roadmaps &amp; More! app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It\’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone\’s security features and it could mean that the miz app won\’t work properly or at all.

The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.

Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app are bound to owners.

Firebase.  Admob.  Google Play Services.  Google Analytics.  Google Crashlytics.          SDK Box.    One Signal.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Kanglei Admin will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Kanglei Admin cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don\’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don\’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you\’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you\’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you\’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, Kanglei Admin cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can\’t turn it on to avail the Service, Kanglei Admin cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to Kanglei Admin\’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you\’re using the app, it\’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Kanglei Admin accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you\’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Kanglei Admin does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

Changes to This Terms and Conditions:

I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

    <string name="boldH1">The Four Cringe - Worthy Mistakes Too Many Startups Make with Data</string>
    <string name="writerN_1">Amanda Richardson</string>
    <string name="sTextPlain_1">Trends can be useful to follow, but they can also be incredibly dangerous. When a serious pursuit—for example, data-driven growth—becomes a trend, it invariably becomes dumbed down by opportunistic \”thought leaders\” and companies looking to ride the trend for their own gain. But doing the dumbed-down version of any serious pursuit will almost always result in failure. In this excellent interview, Amanda Richardson, Chief Data and Strategy Officer for HotelTonight, takes this phenomenon to task and shares some valuable insight on how companies can be smart about data, rather than simply plugging in a metrics dashboard to check a box.</string>
    <string name="bTextPlain_1">I\’ve talked to people at pre-launch startups with fewer than 100 users who say, \’We\’re going to start on personalization, And I\’m thinking, \’What are you going to personalize\? And more importantly, why\? What is the problem you\’re solving\?\’ Often the motivation is that it\’s in a headline or a board member thinks it\’s the secret to success.</string>

    <string name="boldH2">How To Develop Content for Every Stage of the Customer Journey</string>
    <string name="writerN_2">John Jantsch</string>
    <string name="sTextPlain_2">Everyone wants to succeed at content marketing, but where do you start\? John Jantsch answers this question perfectly: with understanding your customer\’s journey, and mapping your content plan to it. The article is a quick read, but is hyper-actionable if you\’re thinking about how to approach content development, or even if you\’d like to repurpose old content with more effective delivery.</string>
    <string name="bTextPlain_2">If you\’ve built trust to the point where people begin wondering how your solution might work for them, it\’s time to enter the Try stage of the hourglass. Try is a phase that many people skip due to the desire to leap rather than lead, however, I think it\’s the easiest phase to move people to the purchase. Here, the content needs to represent a sample of the end result. By creating content in this phase that demonstrates how much better your product or service is than the competition, you can differentiate your business.</string>

    <string name="writerN_3">Patrick Campbell</string>
    <string name="sTextPlain_3">Patrick is one of the sharpest commentators on SaaS, and this is a great example of that. In a few minutes of reading, you can get a pretty good overview of where SaaS is today, where it\’s going, and what you\’ll need to do if you want to succeed. It\’s an extrapolation of a conference talk he gave. The talk is embedded at the top of the article, and is worth watching.</string>
    <string name="bTextPlain_3">While our customers are able to get up and running with new products at record speed, we\’re not able to acquire them at the same clip. The rise in competition in the SaaS market has decreased switching costs and increased our average CAC, despite the fact that we can take advantage of more sales and marketing channels than at any time before. Not only is it getting more difficult (and expensive) to acquire users, but those we do manage to get on our products aren\’t as happy as they used to be. Average NPS scores are ⅓ of what they were five years ago.</string>

    <string name="writerN_4">Maggie Leung</string>
    <string name="sTextPlain_4">There are so many people out there that parrot some form of this cliched management advice: \”Have empathy.\” \”Understand others.\” \”Be human.\” That\’s great and all, but without actionable advice on how to do that, it\’s not much good. It doesn\’t get any more actionable than this. In this interview, Maggie Leung, VP of Content at Nerdwallet, shares 13 sets of questions you can ask yourself in just about any interpersonal scenario (whether you\’re managing, hiring or working together) to be more empathetic and effective.</string>
    <string name="bTextPlain_4">Dynamic empathy isn\’t just about understanding what\’s going on with someone else, but actually doing or saying something about it. It helps you move forward.</string>

    <string name="boldH5">Note to Self, On Time Management</string>
    <string name="writerN_5">Joanna Wiebe</string>
    <string name="sTextPlain_5">Time management is hard for most of us. It\’s certainly something that I\’ve struggled with for as long as I can remember, and if not kept in check, it can mean working on the wrong things for far too long, at the expense of what\’s actually important. This letter to herself is witty and incredibly well-written (as you\’d expect from Joanna), but it\’s also a fantastic reminder to all of us about being more deliberate and ruthless with our precious time.</string>
    <string name="bTextPlain_5">When you say yes to everything, you leave little time for the things YOU want to work on. Shouldn\’t your ask of yourself come before someone else\’s ask\? The answer is yes. It should. Stop being a middle-child-Mennonite-girl and explore the much-travelled-by-others world of nein, niet, nahi, iie, non, nee and no. Other people love that world. They rave about it.</string>

    <string name="boldH6">From an Internal Basecamp Announcement\nRe: Pings/IMS</string>
    <string name="writerN_6">Jason Fried</string>
    <string name="sTextPlain_6">Slack is great. We use it constantly throughout the day to keep in touch. But being so easily accessible also comes with a dark site: costly interruptions. And there\’s an insidious habit in particular that Jason calls out in this article that\’s one of the worst offenders. This piece immediately resonated with me, as I could recognize my own behavior (and that of our team\’s) in it, and I agree wholeheartedly with Jason: it\’s time to stop.</string>
    <string name="bTextPlain_6">Do you ever start a ping with someone by first trying to get their attention\? You say \”ping\” or \”there\?\” Or \”hey!\” Or \”Yo\” (or whatever). You begin with a whistle, and then you only send the rest of your thoughts once someone has whistled back. I do this all the time. It\’s time to stop. Sending a ping with no information would be like sending an email with a subject \”Hey\” but with no body. Then only when someone emailed you back saying \”What\’s up\?\” would you follow up with a separate email containing your complete thought. That would be silly, but it\’s exactly what we\’re doing with pings.</string>

    <string name="boldH7">How Shopify Increased Revenue 90% in 365 days</string>
    <string name="writerN_7">Chris Von Wilpert</string>
    <string name="sTextPlain_7">This guide is massive. But unlike a lot of long-form content, it\’s not just long for the sake of being long; it\’s actually packed with useful takeaways in every section. I love Chris\’ thoughtful dive into Shopify\’s marketing strategy, and how he uncovered advanced tactics and tips that we can all use to improve. Tip #6, about Shopify\’s onboarding email sequence, alone makes the article worth reading.</string>
    <string name="bTextPlain_7">Initially, I was surprised to see that Shopify is trying to sell their paid plans in the very first onboarding email since they push their free trial all over their website. But after some analysis, it makes sense. A free trial offer is a perfect top-of-funnel offer to capture a wide market (both ecommerce beginners and experts). This gets everyone who wants to start an online store signed up and testing out the software. The offer in the email however is targeted at experienced sellers who are already sold on the idea of Shopify. This email gives them the chance to go ahead and sign up while it\’s still fresh in their minds. And Shopify gives buyers peace of mind knowing \”You won\’t be charged until your trial ends\” with the conversion-boosting micro-copy you can see directly below the CTA button.</string>

    <string name="writerN_8">Matthew Barby</string>
    <string name="sTextPlain_8">Matthew\’s guides are always rich and valuable (I plugged his guide to SEO tips in my last roundup), and this one is no exception. I came away from this guide with lots of ideas that we\’re planning to try, and I\’m sure that you will, too.</string>
    <string name="bTextPlain_8">There are a ton of different frameworks that have been published that seek to help you identify the right channel to pursue, but ultimately this comes down to a fair amount of trial and error, especially if you have no historical data to work with. I\’m not going to delve into the details of a framework, per se. Instead I\’m going to give you a host of customer acquisition tactics, as well as a way to test them out, in order to enable you to get a feel for which channels have the potential to deliver the most value.</string>

    <string name="boldH9">The Iceberg Theory of User Feedback</string>
    <string name="writerN_9">Janet Choi</string>
    <string name="sTextPlain_9">You know what your customers are telling you. But do you know what they\’re not telling you\? The delta between those two is often where most churn problems exist. Being able to find those hidden issues and \”under the surface\” feedback, as Janet calls it, is critical to creating happy customers. This post offers several effective ways to do that.</string>
    <string name="bTextPlain_9">You\’re probably hearing from just a sliver of your overall customers. One customer service expert has found that only 4% of dissatisfied customers voice complaints to businesses. If you get 40 support emails (which tend to focus on immediate troubleshooting) each day, but you have 1,000 daily active users, for example, then you have plenty of \”under the surface\” feedback to explore. You might not be heading into the frigid waters to look at what\’s underneath the obvious surfaces. Sometimes what you excavate won\’t amount to much, but sometimes the feedback can crystallize, with some effort and dot-connecting, into some \”Aha\” moments for you.</string>
